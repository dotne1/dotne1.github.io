                    <p>Registry Access Management (RAM) is a security feature allowing administrators to restrict access for their developers to only allowed registries. When a MacOS configuration profile is used to enforce organization sign-in, the RAM policies are not being applied, which would allow Docker Desktop users to pull down unapproved, and potentially malicious images from any registry.</p>
