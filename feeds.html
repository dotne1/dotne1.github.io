eventpoll: fix semi-unbounded recursion

ensure that epoll instances can never form a graph deeper than
ep_max_nests+1 links.

currently, ep_loop_check_proc() ensures that the graph is loop-free and
does some recursion depth checks, but those recursion depth checks don't
limit the depth of the resulting tree for two reasons:

 - they don't look upwards in the tree.
 - if there are multiple downwards paths of different lengths, only one of
   the paths is actually considered for the depth check since commit
   28d82dc1c4ed ("epoll: limit paths").

essentially, the current recursion depth check in ep_loop_check_proc() just
serves to prevent it from recursing too deeply while checking for loops.

a more thorough check is done in reverse_path_check() after the new graph
edge has already been created; this checks, among other things, that no
paths going upwards from any non-epoll file with a length of more than 5
edges exist. however, this check does not apply to non-epoll files.

as a result, it is possible to recurse to a depth of at least roughly 500,
tested on v6.15. (i am unsure if deeper recursion is possible; and this may
have changed with commit 8c44dac8add7 ("eventpoll: fix priority inversion
problem").)

to fix it:

1. in ep_loop_check_proc(), note the subtree depth of each visited node,
and use subtree depths for the total depth calculation even when a subtree
has already been visited.
2. add ep_get_upwards_depth_proc() for similarly determining the maximum
depth of an upwards walk.
3. in ep_loop_check(), use these values to limit the total path length
between epoll nodes to ep_max_nests edges.">

vmci: Prevent the dispatching of uninitialized payloads

The reproducer executes the host's unlocked_ioctl call in two different
tasks. When init_context fails, the struct vmci_event_ctx is not fully
initialized when executing vmci_datagram_dispatch() to send events to all
vm contexts. This affects the datagram taken from the datagram queue of
its context by another task, because the datagram payload is not initialized
according to the size payload_size, which causes the kernel data to leak
to the user space.

Before dispatching the datagram, and before setting the payload content,
explicitly set the payload content to 0 to avoid data leakage caused by
incomplete payload initialization.</p>

wifi: ath12k: avoid accessing uninitialized arvif->ar during beacon miss

during beacon miss handling, ath12k driver iterates over active virtual
interfaces (vifs) and attempts to access the radio object (ar) via
arvif->deflink->ar.

however, after commit aa80f12f3bed ("wifi: ath12k: defer vdev creation for
mlo"), arvif is linked to a radio only after vdev creation, typically when
a channel is assigned or a scan is requested.
for p2p capable devices, a default p2p interface is created by
wpa_supplicant along with regular station interfaces, these serve as dummy
interfaces for p2p-capable stations, lack an associated netdev and initiate
frequent scans to discover neighbor p2p devices. when a scan is initiated
on such p2p vifs, driver selects destination radio (ar) based on scan
frequency, creates a scan vdev, and attaches arvif to the radio. once the
scan completes or is aborted, the scan vdev is deleted, detaching arvif
from the radio and leaving arvif->ar uninitialized.

while handling beacon miss for station interfaces, p2p interface is also
encountered in the vif iteration and ath12k_mac_handle_beacon_miss_iter()
tries to dereference the uninitialized arvif->deflink->ar.

fix this by verifying that vdev is created for the arvif before accessing
its ar during beacon miss handling and similar vif iterator callbacks.

drm/amdgpu: fix slab-use-after-free in amdgpu_userq_mgr_fini+0x70c

the issue was reproduced on nv10 using igt pci_unplug test.
it is expected that `amdgpu_driver_postclose_kms()` is called prior to `amdgpu_drm_release()`.
however, the bug is that `amdgpu_fpriv` was freed in `amdgpu_driver_postclose_kms()`, and then
later accessed in `amdgpu_drm_release()` via a call to `amdgpu_userq_mgr_fini()`.
as a result, kasan detected a use-after-free condition, as shown in the log below.
the proposed fix is to move the calls to `amdgpu_eviction_fence_destroy()` and
`amdgpu_userq_mgr_fini()` into `amdgpu_driver_postclose_kms()`, so they are invoked before
`amdgpu_fpriv` is freed.

this also ensures symmetry with the initialization path in `amdgpu_driver_open_kms()`,
where the following components are initialized:
- `amdgpu_userq_mgr_init()`
- `amdgpu_eviction_fence_init()`
- `amdgpu_ctx_mgr_init()`

correspondingly, in `amdgpu_driver_postclose_kms()` we should clean up using:
- `amdgpu_userq_mgr_fini()`
- `amdgpu_eviction_fence_destroy()`
- `amdgpu_ctx_mgr_fini()`

this change eliminates the use-after-free and improves consistency in resource management between open and close paths.
