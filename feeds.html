btrfs: avoid potential out-of-bounds in btrfs_encode_fh()

the function btrfs_encode_fh() does not properly account for the three
cases it handles.

before writing to the file handle (fh), the function only returns to the
user btrfs_fid_size_non_connectable (5 dwords, 20 bytes) or
btrfs_fid_size_connectable (8 dwords, 32 bytes).

however, when a parent exists and the root id of the parent and the
inode are different, the function writes btrfs_fid_size_connectable_root
(10 dwords, 40 bytes).

if *max_len is not large enough, this write goes out of bounds because
btrfs_fid_size_connectable_root is greater than
btrfs_fid_size_connectable originally returned.

this results in an 8-byte out-of-bounds write at
fid->parent_root_objectid = parent_root_id.

a previous attempt to fix this issue was made but was lost.

although this issue does not seem to be easily triggerable, it is a

resolves the issue by ensuring the function returns the appropriate size
