affected scope
component: sensitive fields in hive-site.xml (e.g., javax.jdo.option.connectionpassword) or other fields encoded in base64.
version: apache linkis 1.0.0 – 1.7.0


trigger conditions
the value of the configuration item is an invalid base64 string.

problem description
when using the jdbc engine and da
when using the jdbc engine and data source functionality, if the url parameter configured on the frontend has undergone multiple rounds of url encoding, it may bypass the system's checks. this bypass can trigger a vulnerability that allows unauthorized access to system files via jdbc parameters.

scope of impact


this issue affects apache linkis: from 1.3.0 through 1.7.0.

severity level


moderate
solution
continuously check if the connection information contains the "%" character; if it does, perform url decoding.

users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.8.0, which fixes the issue.

                    <p>A vulnerability in Apache Linkis.

Problem Description
When using the JDBC engine and da
When using the JDBC engine and data source functionality, if the URL parameter configured on the frontend has undergone multiple rounds of URL encoding, it may bypass the system's checks. This bypass can trigger a vulnerability that allows unauthorized access to system files via JDBC parameters.

Scope of Impact


This issue affects Apache Linkis: from 1.3.0 through 1.7.0.

Severity level


moderate
Solution
Continuously check if the connection information contains the "%" character; if it does, perform URL decoding.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.8.0, which fixes the issue.
