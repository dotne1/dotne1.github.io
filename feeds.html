                    <p>VariCAD EN up to and including version 2010-2.05 is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow when parsing .dwb drawing files. The application fails to properly validate the length of input data embedded in the file, allowing a crafted .dwb file to overwrite critical memory structures. This flaw can be exploited locally by convincing a user to open a malicious file, resulting in arbitrary code execution.</p>
