                    <p>The Post Carousel Slider for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to improper authorization due to a missing capability check on the process_wbelps_promo_form() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to trigger the plugin’s support‐form handler to send arbitrary emails to the site’s support address.</p>
