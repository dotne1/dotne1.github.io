for example, a client can open a stream and then send window_update frames with window size increment of 0, which is illegal.
per specification  https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113.html#name-window_update , the server should send a rst_stream frame.
the client can now open another stream and send another bad window_update, therefore causing the server to consume more resources than necessary, as this case does not exceed the max number of concurrent streams, yet the client is able to create an enormous amount of streams in a short period of time.


the attack can be performed with other conditions (for example, a data frame for a closed stream) that cause the server to send a rst_stream frame.
