                    <p>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') vulnerability in the software keyboard function (hereinafter referred to as "keypad function") of Mitsubishi Electric GENESIS64 versions 10.97.2 CFR3 and prior, Mitsubishi Electric Iconics Digital Solutions GENESIS64 versions 10.97.2 CFR3 and prior, Mitsubishi Electric ICONICS Suite versions 10.97.2 CFR3 and prior, Mitsubishi Electric Iconics Digital Solutions ICONICS Suite versions 10.97.2 CFR3 and prior, Mitsubishi Electric MobileHMI versions 10.97.2 CFR3 and prior, Mitsubishi Electric Iconics Digital Solutions MobileHMI versions 10.97.2 CFR3 and prior, and Mitsubishi Electric MC Works64 all versions allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary executable files (EXE) when a legitimate user uses the keypad function by tampering with the configuration file for the function. This could allow the attacker to disclose, tamper with, delete, or destroy information stored on the PC where the affected product is installed, or cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the system, through the execution of the EXE.</p>
