crypto: qat - fix out-of-bounds read

when preparing an aer-ctr request, the driver copies the key provided by
the user into a data structure that is accessible by the firmware.
if the target device is qat gen4, the key size is rounded up by 16 since
a rounded up size is expected by the device.
if the key size is rounded up before the copy, the size used for copying
the key might be bigger than the size of the region containing the key,
causing an out-of-bounds read.

fix by doing the copy first and then update the keylen.

this is to fix the following warning reported by kasan:

                    <p>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: qat - fix out-of-bounds read

When preparing an AER-CTR request, the driver copies the key provided by
the user into a data structure that is accessible by the firmware.
If the target device is QAT GEN4, the key size is rounded up by 16 since
a rounded up size is expected by the device.
If the key size is rounded up before the copy, the size used for copying
the key might be bigger than the size of the region containing the key,
causing an out-of-bounds read.

Fix by doing the copy first and then update the keylen.

This is to fix the following warning reported by KASAN:

this is how it happened:

      __device_release_driver()
        klist_remove(&dev->p->knode_driver) <-- it causes null-ptr-deref.

    // normal path
    bus_probe_device() // it's not called yet.
      device_bind_driver()

if dev->driver is set, in the error path after calling bus_add_device()
in device_add(), bus_remove_device() is called, then the device will be
detached from driver. but device_bind_driver() is not called yet, so it
causes null-ptr-deref while access the 'knode_driver'. to fix this, set
dev->driver to null in the error path before calling bus_remove_device().">
