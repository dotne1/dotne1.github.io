this cve covers the same vulnerability as in cve-2025-54988. however, this cve expands the scope of affected packages in two ways. 

first, while the entrypoint for the vulnerability was the tika-parser-pdf-module as reported in cve-2025-54988, the vulnerability and its fix were in tika-core. users who upgraded the tika-parser-pdf-module but did not upgrade tika-core to >= 3.2.2 would still be vulnerable. 

second, the original report failed to mention that in the 1.x tika releases, the pdfparser was in the "org.apache.tika:tika-parsers" module.">

                    <p>Critical XXE in Apache Tika tika-core (1.13-3.2.1), tika-pdf-module (2.0.0-3.2.1) and tika-parsers (1.13-1.28.5) modules on all platforms allows an attacker to carry out XML External Entity injection via a crafted XFA file inside of a PDF. 

This CVE covers the same vulnerability as in CVE-2025-54988. However, this CVE expands the scope of affected packages in two ways. 

First, while the entrypoint for the vulnerability was the tika-parser-pdf-module as reported in CVE-2025-54988, the vulnerability and its fix were in tika-core. Users who upgraded the tika-parser-pdf-module but did not upgrade tika-core to >= 3.2.2 would still be vulnerable. 

Second, the original report failed to mention that in the 1.x Tika releases, the PDFParser was in the "org.apache.tika:tika-parsers" module.</p>
