net_sched: hfsc: fix a uaf vulnerability in class handling

this patch fixes a use-after-free vulnerability in the hfsc qdisc class
handling. the issue occurs due to a time-of-check/time-of-use condition
in hfsc_change_class() when working with certain child qdiscs like netem
or codel.

the vulnerability works as follows:
1. hfsc_change_class() checks if a class has packets (q.qlen != 0)
2. it then calls qdisc_peek_len(), which for certain qdiscs (e.g.,
   codel, netem) might drop packets and empty the queue
3. the code continues assuming the queue is still non-empty, adding
   the class to vttree
4. this breaks hfsc scheduler assumptions that only non-empty classes
   are in vttree
5. later, when the class is destroyed, this can lead to a use-after-free

the fix adds a second queue length check after qdisc_peek_len() to verify
the queue wasn't emptied.">
