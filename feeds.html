net_sched: hfsc: fix a uaf vulnerability in class with netem as child qdisc

as described in gerrard's report [1], we have a uaf case when an hfsc class
has a netem child qdisc. the crux of the issue is that hfsc is assuming
that checking for cl->qdisc->q.qlen == 0 guarantees that it hasn't inserted
the class in the vttree or eltree (which is not true for the netem
duplicate case).

this patch checks the n_active class variable to make sure that the code
won't insert the class in the vttree or eltree twice, catering for the
reentrant case.
