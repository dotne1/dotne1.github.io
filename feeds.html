                    <p>A vulnerability has been found in TDuckCloud tduck-platform up to 5.1 and classified as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is the function preHandle of the file /manage/ of the component com.tduck.cloud.api.web.interceptor.AuthorizationInterceptor. The manipulation leads to improper authorization. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.</p>

bluetooth: btnxpuart: resolve tx timeout error in power save stress test

this fixes the tx timeout issue seen while running a stress test on
btnxpuart for couple of hours, such that the interval between two hci
commands coincide with the power save timeout value of 2 seconds.

test procedure using bash script:
<load btnxpuart.ko>
hciconfig hci0 up
//enable power save feature
hcitool -i hci0 cmd 3f 23 02 00 00
while (true)
do
    hciconfig hci0 leadv
    sleep 2
    hciconfig hci0 noleadv
    sleep 2
done

error log, after adding few more debug prints:
bluetooth: btnxpuart_queue_skb(): 01 0a 20 01 00
bluetooth: hci0: set uart break: on, status=0
bluetooth: hci0: btnxpuart_tx_wakeup() tx_work scheduled
bluetooth: hci0: btnxpuart_tx_work() dequeue: 01 0a 20 01 00
can't set advertise mode on hci0: connection timed out (110)
bluetooth: hci0: command 0x200a tx timeout

when the power save mechanism turns on uart break, and btnxpuart_tx_work()
is scheduled simultaneously, psdata->ps_state is read as ps_state_awake,
which prevents the psdata->work from being scheduled, which is responsible
to turn off uart break.

this issue is fixed by adding a ps_lock mutex around uart break on/off as
well as around ps_state read/write.
btnxpuart_tx_wakeup() will now read updated ps_state value. if ps_state is
ps_state_sleep, it will first schedule psdata->work, and then it will
reschedule itself once uart break has been turned off and ps_state is
ps_state_awake.

tested above script for 50,000 iterations and tx timeout error was not
observed anymore.">
