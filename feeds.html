   since this site is not secure, the cookie *should* just be ignored.
4. a bug in the path comparison logic makes curl read outside a heap buffer
   boundary

the bug either causes a crash or it potentially makes the comparison come to
the wrong conclusion and lets the clear-text site override the contents of the
secure cookie, contrary to expectations and depending on the memory contents
immediately following the single-byte allocation that holds the path.

the presumed and correct behavior would be to plainly ignore the second set of
the cookie since it was already set as secure on a secure host so overriding
it on an insecure host should not be okay.">

                    <p>1. A cookie is set using the `secure` keyword for `https://target`
2. curl is redirected to or otherwise made to speak with `http://target` (same
   hostname, but using clear text HTTP) using the same cookie set
3. The same cookie name is set - but with just a slash as path (`path='/'`).
   Since this site is not secure, the cookie *should* just be ignored.
4. A bug in the path comparison logic makes curl read outside a heap buffer
   boundary

The bug either causes a crash or it potentially makes the comparison come to
the wrong conclusion and lets the clear-text site override the contents of the
secure cookie, contrary to expectations and depending on the memory contents
immediately following the single-byte allocation that holds the path.

The presumed and correct behavior would be to plainly ignore the second set of
the cookie since it was already set as secure on a secure host so overriding
it on an insecure host should not be okay.</p>
