                    <p>xdg-open in xdg-utils through 1.2.1 can send requests containing SameSite=Strict cookies, which can facilitate CSRF. (For example, xdg-open could be modified to, by default, associate x-scheme-handler/https with the execution of a browser with command-line options that arrange for an empty cookie store, although this would add substantial complexity, and would not be considered a desirable or expected behavior by all users.) NOTE: this is disputed because integrations of xdg-open typically do not provide information about whether the xdg-open command and arguments were manually entered by a user, or whether they were the result of a navigation from content in an untrusted origin.</p>
