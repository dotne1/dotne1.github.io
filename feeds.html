                    <p>The BeeTeam368 Extensions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the handle_submit_upload_file() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access or higher to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.</p>
