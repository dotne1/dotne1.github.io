The `applyPatch` method is similarly affected if (and only if) called with a string representation of a patch as an argument, since under the hood it parses that string using `parsePatch`. Other methods of the library are unaffected. Finally, a second and lesser interdependent bug - a ReDOS - also exhibits when those same line break characters are present in a patch's *patch* header (also known as its "leading garbage"). A maliciously-crafted patch header of length *n* can take `parsePatch` O(*n*³) time to parse. Versions 8.0.3, 5.2.2, and 4.0.4 contain a fix. As a workaround, do not attempt to parse patches that contain any of these characters: `\r`, `\u2028`, or `\u2029`.</p>
