impact summary: an out-of-bounds read can trigger a crash which leads to
denial of service for an application.

the openssl http client api functions can be used directly by applications

management protocol) client implementation in openssl. however the urls used
by these implementations are unlikely to be controlled by an attacker.

in this vulnerable code the out of bounds read can only trigger a crash.
furthermore the vulnerability requires an attacker-controlled url to be
passed from an application to the openssl function and the user has to have
a 'no_proxy' environment variable set. for the aforementioned reasons the
issue was assessed as low severity.

the vulnerable code was introduced in the following patch releases:
3.0.16, 3.1.8, 3.2.4, 3.3.3, 3.4.0 and 3.5.0.

openssl does not directly support certificates with sm2 keys in tls, and so
this cve is not relevant in most tls contexts.  however, given that it is
possible to add support for such certificates via a custom provider, coupled
with the fact that in such a custom provider context the private key may be
