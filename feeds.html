fuse: fix livelock in synchronous file put from fuseblk workers

i observed a hang when running generic/323 against a fuseblk server.
this test opens a file, initiates a lot of aio writes to that file

unsurprisingly, the aio exerciser threads are mostly stuck waiting for
responses from the fuseblk server:

the fuseblk server is fuse2fs so there's nothing all that exciting in
the server itself.  so why is the fuse server calling fuse_file_put?
the commit message for the fstest sheds some light on that:

"by closing the file descriptor before calling io_destroy, you pretty
much guarantee that the last put on the ioctx will be done in interrupt
context (during i/o completion).

aha.  aio fgets a new struct file from the fd when it queues the ioctx.
the completion of the fuse_write command from userspace causes the fuse
server to call the aio completion function.  the completion puts the
struct file, queuing a delayed fput to the fuse server task.  when the
fuse server task returns to userspace, it has to run the delayed fput,
which in the case of a fuseblk server, it does synchronously.

sending the fuse_release command sychronously from fuse server threads
is a bad idea because a client program can initiate enough simultaneous
aios such that all the fuse server threads end up in delayed_fput, and
now there aren't any threads left to handle the queued fuse commands.

fix this by only using asynchronous fputs when closing files, and leave
a comment explaining why.">

pci/iov: add pci rescan-remove locking when enabling/disabling sr-iov

before disabling sr-iov via config space accesses to the parent pf,
sriov_disable() first removes the pci devices representing the vfs.

since commit 9d16947b7583 ("pci: add global pci_lock_rescan_remove()")
such removal operations are serialized against concurrent remove and
rescan using the pci_rescan_remove_lock. no such locking was ever added
in sriov_disable() however. in particular when commit 18f9e9d150fc
("pci/iov: factor out sriov_add_vfs()") factored out the pci device
removal into sriov_del_vfs() there was still no locking around the
pci_iov_remove_virtfn() calls.

on s390 the lack of serialization in sriov_disable() may cause double
remove and list corruption with the below (amended) trace being observed:

this is because in addition to sriov_disable() removing the vfs, the
platform also generates hot-unplug events for the vfs. this being the
reverse operation to the hotplug events generated by sriov_enable() and
handled via pdev->no_vf_scan. and while the event processing takes
pci_rescan_remove_lock and checks whether the struct pci_dev still exists,
the lack of synchronization makes this checking racy.

other races may also be possible of course though given that this lack of
locking persisted so long observable races seem very rare. even on s390 the
list corruption was only observed with certain devices since the platform
events are only triggered by config accesses after the removal, so as long
as the removal finished synchronously they would not race. either way the
locking is missing so fix this by adding it to the sriov_del_vfs() helper.

just like pci rescan-remove, locking is also missing in sriov_add_vfs()
including for the error case where pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device() is
called without the pci rescan-remove lock being held. even in the non-error
case, adding new pci devices and buses should be serialized via the pci
rescan-remove lock. add the necessary locking.">

                    <p>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI/IOV: Add PCI rescan-remove locking when enabling/disabling SR-IOV

Before disabling SR-IOV via config space accesses to the parent PF,
sriov_disable() first removes the PCI devices representing the VFs.

Since commit 9d16947b7583 ("PCI: Add global pci_lock_rescan_remove()")
such removal operations are serialized against concurrent remove and
rescan using the pci_rescan_remove_lock. No such locking was ever added
in sriov_disable() however. In particular when commit 18f9e9d150fc
("PCI/IOV: Factor out sriov_add_vfs()") factored out the PCI device
removal into sriov_del_vfs() there was still no locking around the
pci_iov_remove_virtfn() calls.

On s390 the lack of serialization in sriov_disable() may cause double
remove and list corruption with the below (amended) trace being observed:
