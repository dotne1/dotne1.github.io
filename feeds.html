                    <p>A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in multiple [Vendor Name] products due to a business logic flaw in SOAP admin services. A malicious actor can create a new user with elevated permissions only when all of the following conditions are met:
  *  SOAP admin services are accessible to the attacker.
  *  The deployment includes an internally used attribute that is not part of the default WSO2 product configuration.
  *  At least one custom role exists with non-default permissions.
  *  The attacker has knowledge of the custom role and the internal attribute used in the deployment.


Exploiting this vulnerability allows malicious actors to assign higher privileges to self-registered users, bypassing intended access control mechanisms.</p>

a suid binary or process has a special type of permission, which allows the process to run with the file owner's permissions, regardless of the user executing the binary. this allows the process to access more restricted data than unprivileged users or processes would be able to. an attacker can leverage this flaw by forcing a suid process to crash and force the linux kernel to recycle the process pid before systemd-coredump can analyze the /proc/pid/auxv file. if the attacker wins the race condition, they gain access to the original's suid process coredump file. they can read sensitive content loaded into memory by the original binary, affecting data confidentiality.">
