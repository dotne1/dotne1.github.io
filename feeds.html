                    <p>The User Submitted Posts – Enable Users to Submit Posts from the Front End plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'usp_access' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 20260110 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.</p>

                <div class="cve-entry" data-cve-id="CVE-2025-60021" data-description="remote command injection vulnerability in heap profiler builtin service in apache brpc ((all versions < 1.15.0)) on all platforms allows attacker to inject remote command.



root cause: the brpc heap profiler built-in service (/pprof/heap) does not validate the user-provided extra_options parameter and executes it as a command-line argument. attackers can execute remote commands using the extra_options parameter..

affected scenarios: use the built-in brpc heap profiler service to perform jemalloc memory profiling.

how to fix: we provide two methods, you can choose one of them:

1. upgrade brpc to version 1.15.0.
2. apply this patch ( https://github.com/apache/brpc/pull/3101 ) manually.">
