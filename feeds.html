4. a bug in the path comparison logic makes curl read outside a heap buffer

the bug either causes a crash or it potentially makes the comparison come to
the wrong conclusion and lets the clear-text site override the contents of the
secure cookie, contrary to expectations and depending on the memory contents
immediately following the single-byte allocation that holds the path.

the presumed and correct behavior would be to plainly ignore the second set of
the cookie since it was already set as secure on a secure host so overriding
it on an insecure host should not be okay.">
