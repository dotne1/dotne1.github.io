                    <p>DNN (formerly DotNetNuke) is an open-source web content management platform (CMS) in the Microsoft ecosystem. Prior to 10.1.1, the out-of-box experience for HTML editing allows unauthenticated users to upload files. This opens a potential vector to other security issues and is not needed on most implementations. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.1.1.</p>
