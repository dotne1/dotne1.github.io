tee: optee: fix supplicant wait loop

op-tee supplicant is a user-space daemon and it's possible for it
be hung or crashed or killed in the middle of processing an op-tee
rpc call. it becomes more complicated when there is incorrect shutdown
ordering of the supplicant process vs the op-tee client application which
can eventually lead to system hang-up waiting for the closure of the
client application.

allow the client process waiting in kernel for supplicant response to
be killed rather than indefinitely waiting in an unkillable state. also,
a normal uninterruptible wait should not have resulted in the hung-task
watchdog getting triggered, but the endless loop would.

this fixes issues observed during system reboot/shutdown when supplicant
got hung for some reason or gets crashed/killed which lead to client
getting hung in an unkillable state. it in turn lead to system being in
hung up state requiring hard power off/on to recover.">
