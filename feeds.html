net_sched: hfsc: address reentrant enqueue adding class to eltree twice

savino says:
    "we are writing to report that this recent patch
    (141d34391abbb315d68556b7c67ad97885407547) [1]
    can be bypassed, and a uaf can still occur when hfsc is utilized with
    netem.

    the patch only checks the cl->cl_nactive field to determine whether
    it is the first insertion or not [2], but this field is only
    incremented by init_vf [3].

    by using hfsc_rsc (which uses init_ed) [4], it is possible to bypass the
    check and insert the class twice in the eltree.
    under normal conditions, this would lead to an infinite loop in
    hfsc_dequeue for the reasons we already explained in this report [5].

    however, if tbf is added as root qdisc and it is configured with a
    very low rate,
    it can be utilized to prevent packets from being dequeued.
    this behavior can be exploited to perform subsequent insertions in the
    hfsc eltree and cause a uaf."

to fix both the uaf and the infinite loop, with netem as an hfsc child,
check explicitly in hfsc_enqueue whether the class is already in the eltree
whenever the hfsc_rsc flag is set.
