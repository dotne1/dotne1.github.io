                    <p>A reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in Revive Adserver version 5.5.2. An attacker could trick a user with access to the user interface of a Revive Adserver instance into clicking on a specifically crafted URL and execute injected JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.  The session cookie cannot be accessed, but a number of other operations could be performed.

The vulnerability is present in the admin-search.php file and can be exploited via the compact parameter.</p>
