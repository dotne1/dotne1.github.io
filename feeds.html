                    <p>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in Apache VCL. Users can modify form data submitted when requesting a new Block Allocation such that a SELECT SQL statement is modified. The data returned by the SELECT statement is not viewable by the attacker.

This issue affects all versions of Apache VCL from 2.2 through 2.5.1.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.5.2, which fixes the issue.</p>
