                    <p>The Export All Posts, Products, Orders, Refunds & Users plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.19. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the `parseData` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to export sensitive information including user data, email addresses, password hashes, and WooCommerce data to an attacker-controlled file path on the server via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.</p>
