                    <p>A vulnerability exists in Advantech iView versions prior to 5.7.05 build
 7057, which could allow a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. 
By manipulating specific parameters, an attacker could execute 
unauthorized scripts in the user's browser, potentially leading to 
information disclosure or other malicious activities.</p>
