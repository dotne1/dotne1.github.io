usb: xhci: don't skip on stopped - length invalid

up until commit d56b0b2ab142 ("usb: xhci: ensure skipped isoc tds are
returned when isoc ring is stopped") in v6.11, the driver didn't skip
missed isochronous tds when handling stoppend and stopped - length
invalid events. instead, it erroneously cleared the skip flag, which
would cause the ring to get stuck, as future events won't match the
missed td which is never removed from the queue until it's cancelled.

this buggy logic seems to have been in place substantially unchanged
since the 3.x series over 10 years ago, which probably speaks first
and foremost about relative rarity of this case in normal usage, but
by the spec i see no reason why it shouldn't be possible.

after d56b0b2ab142, tds are immediately skipped when handling those
stopped events. this poses a potential problem in case of stopped -
length invalid, which occurs either on completed tds (likely already
given back) or link and no-op trbs. such event won't be recognized
as matching any td (unless it's the rare link trb inside a td) and
will result in skipping all pending tds, giving them back possibly
before they are done, risking isoc data loss and maybe uaf by hw.

as a compromise, don't skip and don't clear the skip flag on this
kind of event. then the next event will skip missed tds. a downside
of not handling stopped - length invalid on a link inside a td is
that if the td is cancelled, its actual length will not be updated
to account for trbs (silently) completed before the td was stopped.

i had no luck producing this sequence of completion events so there
is no compelling demonstration of any resulting disaster. it may be
a very rare, obscure condition. the sole motivation for this patch
is that if such unlikely event does occur, i'd rather risk reporting
a cancelled partially done isoc frame as empty than gamble with uaf.

this will be fixed more properly by looking at stopped event's trb
pointer when making skipping decisions, but such rework is unlikely
to be backported to v6.12, which will stay around for a few years.">

usb: xhci: apply the link chain quirk on nec isoc endpoints

two clearly different specimens of nec upd720200 (one with start/stop

service errors. faulting address is immediately after a transfer ring
segment and patched dynamic debug messages revealed that the mse was
received when waiting for a td near the end of that segment:

it gets even funnier if the next page is a ring segment accessible to
the hc. below, it reports mse in segment at ff1e8000, plows through a
zero-filled page at ff1e9000 and starts reporting events for trbs in

it's possible that data from the isochronous device were written to
random buffers of pending tds on other endpoints (either in or out),
other devices or even other hcs in the same iommu domain.

lastly, an error from a different usb device on another hc. was it
caused by the above? i don't know, but it may have been. the disk
was working without any other issues and generated pcie traffic to
starve the nec of upstream bw and trigger those mses. the two hcs
shared one x1 slot by means of a commercial "pcie splitter" board.

fortunately, it appears that this ridiculous bug is avoided by setting
the chain bit of link trbs on isochronous rings. other ancient hcs are
known which also expect the bit to be set and they ignore link trbs if
it's not. reportedly, 0.95 spec guaranteed that the bit is set.

the bandwidth-starved nec hc running a 32kb/uframe uvc endpoint reports
tens of mses per second and runs into the bug within seconds. chaining
link trbs allows the same workload to run for many minutes, many times.

netfilter: socket: lookup orig tuple for ipv6 snat

nf_sk_lookup_slow_v4 does the conntrack lookup for ipv4 packets to
restore the original 5-tuple in case of snat, to be able to find the
right socket (if any). then socket_match() can correctly check whether
the socket was transparent.

however, the ipv6 counterpart (nf_sk_lookup_slow_v6) lacks this
conntrack lookup, making xt_socket fail to match on the socket when the
packet was snated. add the same logic to nf_sk_lookup_slow_v6.

ipv6 snat is used in kubernetes clusters for pod-to-world packets, as
pods' addresses are in the fd00::/8 ula subnet and need to be replaced
with the node's external address. cilium leverages envoy to enforce l7
policies, and envoy uses transparent sockets. cilium inserts an iptables
prerouting rule that matches on `-m socket --transparent` and redirects
the packets to localhost, but it fails to match snated ipv6 packets due
to that missing conntrack lookup.">
