                    <p>ZenTao Biz < 6.5, ZenTao Max < 3.0, ZenTao Open Source Edition < 16.5, and ZenTao Open Source Edition < 16.5.beta1 contain an SQL injection vulnerability in the login functionality. The application does not properly validate the account parameter on /zentao/user-login.html before using it in a database query. A remote unauthenticated attacker can exploit this issue to execute crafted SQL expressions and retrieve sensitive information from the backend database, including user and application data. Exploitation evidence was observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2025-02-07 UTC.</p>
