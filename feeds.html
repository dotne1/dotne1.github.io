                    <p>An improper authorization vulnerability in Dremio Software allows authenticated users to delete arbitrary files that the system has access to, including system files and files stored in remote locations such as S3, Azure Blob Storage, and local filesystems. This vulnerability exists due to insufficient access controls on an API endpoint, enabling any authenticated user to specify and delete files outside their intended scope. Exploiting this flaw could lead to data loss, denial of service (DoS), and potential escalation of impact depending on the deleted files.

Affected versions:
  *  Any version of Dremio below 24.0.0


  *  Dremio 24.3.0 - 24.3.16


  *  Dremio 25.0.0 - 25.0.14


  *  Dremio 25.1.0 - 25.1.7


  *  Dremio 25.2.0 - 25.2.4





Fixed in version: 
  *  Dremio 24.3.17 and above


  *  Dremio 25.0.15 and above


  *  Dremio 25.1.8 and above


  *  Dremio 25.2.5 and above


  *  Dremio 26.0.0 and above</p>
