                    <p>Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in TelegAI (telegai.com) thru 2025-05-26 in its chat component. An attacker can exploit this IDOR to tamper other users' conversation. Additionally, malicious contents and XSS payloads can be injected, leading to phishing attack, user spoofing and account hijacking via XSS.</p>
