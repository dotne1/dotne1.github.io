net: sock: fix hardened usercopy panic in sock_recv_errqueue

skbuff_fclone_cache was created without defining a usercopy region,
[1] unlike skbuff_head_cache which properly whitelists the cb[] field.
[2] this causes a usercopy bug() when config_hardened_usercopy is
enabled and the kernel attempts to copy sk_buff.cb data to userspace
via sock_recv_errqueue() -> put_cmsg().

the crash occurs when: 1. tcp allocates an skb using alloc_skb_fclone()
   (from skbuff_fclone_cache) [1]
2. the skb is cloned via skb_clone() using the pre-allocated fclone
[3] 3. the cloned skb is queued to sk_error_queue for timestamp
reporting 4. userspace reads the error queue via recvmsg(msg_errqueue)
5. sock_recv_errqueue() calls put_cmsg() to copy serr->ee from skb->cb
[4] 6. __check_heap_object() fails because skbuff_fclone_cache has no
   usercopy whitelist [5]

when cloned skbs allocated from skbuff_fclone_cache are used in the
socket error queue, accessing the sock_exterr_skb structure in skb->cb
via put_cmsg() triggers a usercopy hardening violation:

the crash offset 296 corresponds to skb2->cb within skbuff_fclones:
  - sizeof(struct sk_buff) = 232 - offsetof(struct sk_buff, cb) = 40 -
  offset of skb2.cb in fclones = 232 + 40 = 272 - crash offset 296 =
  272 + 24 (inside sock_exterr_skb.ee)

this patch uses a local stack variable as a bounce buffer to avoid the hardened usercopy check failure.
