af_unix: don't leave consecutive consumed oob skbs.

jann horn reported a use-after-free in unix_stream_read_generic().

the following sequences reproduce the issue:

  $ python3
  from socket import *
  s1, s2 = socketpair(af_unix, sock_stream)
  s1.send(b'x', msg_oob)
  s2.recv(1, msg_oob)     # leave a consumed oob skb
  s1.send(b'y', msg_oob)
  s2.recv(1, msg_oob)     # leave a consumed oob skb
  s1.send(b'z', msg_oob)
  s2.recv(1)              # recv 'z' illegally
  s2.recv(1, msg_oob)     # access 'z' skb (use-after-free)

even though a user reads oob data, the skb holding the data stays on
the recv queue to mark the oob boundary and break the next recv().

after the last send() in the scenario above, the sk2's recv queue has
2 leading consumed oob skbs and 1 real oob skb.

then, the following happens during the next recv() without msg_oob

  1. unix_stream_read_generic() peeks the first consumed oob skb
  2. manage_oob() returns the next consumed oob skb
  3. unix_stream_read_generic() fetches the next not-yet-consumed oob skb
  4. unix_stream_read_generic() reads and frees the oob skb

, and the last recv(msg_oob) triggers kasan splat.

the 3. above occurs because of the so_peek_off code, which does not
expect unix_skb_len(skb) to be 0, but this is true for such consumed
oob skbs.

  while (skip >= unix_skb_len(skb)) {
    skip -= unix_skb_len(skb);
    skb = skb_peek_next(skb, &sk->sk_receive_queue);
    ...
  }

in addition to this use-after-free, there is another issue that
ioctl(siocatmark) does not function properly with consecutive consumed
oob skbs.

so, nothing good comes out of such a situation.

instead of complicating manage_oob(), ioctl() handling, and the next
econnreset fix by introducing a loop for consecutive consumed oob skbs,
let's not leave such consecutive oob unnecessarily.

now, while receiving an oob skb in unix_stream_recv_urg(), if its
previous skb is a consumed oob skb, it is freed.

Jann Horn reported a use-after-free in unix_stream_read_generic().

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary .php files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where .php files can be uploaded and included.</p>
