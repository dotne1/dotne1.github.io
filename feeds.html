deployments that accept jndi uris for jcr lookup from untrusted users allows them to inject malicious jndi references, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution through deserialization of untrusted data.
users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.22.2. jcr lookup through jndi has been disabled by default in 2.22.2. users of this feature need to enable it explicitly and are adviced to review their use of jndi uri for jcr lookup.">
