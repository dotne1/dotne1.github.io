                    <p>An Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an adjacent unauthenticated attacker to cause a memory corruption that leads to a rpd crash. 











When
the logical interface using a routing instance flaps continuously, specific updates are sent to the jflow/sflow modules. This results in memory corruption, leading to an rpd crash and restart. 


Continued receipt of these specific updates will cause a sustained Denial of Service condition.


This issue affects Junos OS:
