                    <p>A vulnerability was found in slackero phpwcms up to 1.9.45/1.10.8. It has been rated as critical. This issue affects the function file_get_contents/is_file of the file include/inc_lib/content/cnt21.readform.inc.php of the component Custom Source Tab. The manipulation of the argument cpage_custom leads to deserialization. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 1.9.46 and 1.10.9 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.</p>

you are affected by this vulnerability if using the tarfile module to extract untrusted tar archives using tarfile.extractall() or tarfile.extract() using the filter= parameter with a value of "data" or "tar". see the tarfile  extraction filters documentation https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile-extraction-filter  for more information. only python versions 3.12 or later are affected by these vulnerabilities, earlier versions don't include the extraction filter feature.

note that for python 3.14 or later the default value of filter= changed from "no filtering" to `"data", so if you are relying on this new default behavior then your usage is also affected.

note that none of these vulnerabilities significantly affect the installation of source distributions which are tar archives as source distributions already allow arbitrary code execution during the build process. however when evaluating source distributions it's important to avoid installing source distributions with suspicious links.">
