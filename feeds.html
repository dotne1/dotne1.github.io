The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralize user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users. (CWE-79) 



 



Description 



 



Hitachi Vantara Pentaho Business Analytics Server prior to versions 10.2.0.2, including 9.3.x and 8.3.x, allow a malicious URL to inject content into the Analyzer plugin interface. 



 



Impact 



 



Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site.</p>
