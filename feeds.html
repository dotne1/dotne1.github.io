                    <p>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary files to an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to improper validation of files that are uploaded to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted file upload request to a specific API endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to upload arbitrary files to an affected system. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have at least valid Config Managers credentials on the affected device.</p>

this vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious code into specific data fields in the interface. a successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have valid administrative credentials.">
