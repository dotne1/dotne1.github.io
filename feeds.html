xfrm: delete x->tunnel as we delete x

the ipcomp fallback tunnels currently get deleted (from the various
lists and hashtables) as the last user state that needed that fallback
is destroyed (not deleted). if a reference to that user state still
exists, the fallback state will remain on the hashtables/lists,
triggering the warn in xfrm_state_fini. because of those remaining
references, the fix in commit f75a2804da39 ("xfrm: destroy xfrm_state
synchronously on net exit path") is not complete.

we recently fixed one such situation in tcp due to defered freeing of
skbs (commit 9b6412e6979f ("tcp: drop secpath at the same time as we
currently drop dst")). this can also happen due to ip reassembly: skbs
with a secpath remain on the reassembly queue until netns
destruction. if we can't guarantee that the queues are flushed by the
time xfrm_state_fini runs, there may still be references to a (user)
xfrm_state, preventing the timely deletion of the corresponding
fallback state.

instead of chasing each instance of skbs holding a secpath one by one,
this patch fixes the issue directly within xfrm, by deleting the
fallback state as soon as the last user state depending on it has been
deleted. destruction will still happen when the final reference is
dropped.

a separate lockdep class for the fallback state is required since
we're going to lock x->tunnel while x is locked.">

af_unix: initialise scc_index in unix_add_edge().

quang le reported that the af_unix gc could garbage-collect a
receive queue of an alive in-flight socket, with a nice repro.

the repro consists of three stages.

  1)
    1-a. create a single cyclic reference with many sockets
    1-b. close() all sockets
    1-c. trigger gc

  2)
    2-a. pass sk-a to an embryo sk-b
    2-b. pass sk-x to sk-x
    2-c. trigger gc

  3)
    3-a. accept() the embryo sk-b
    3-b. pass sk-b to sk-c
    3-c. close() the in-flight sk-a
    3-d. trigger gc

as of 2-c, sk-a and sk-x are linked to unix_unvisited_vertices,
and unix_walk_scc() groups them into two different sccs:

  unix_sk(sk-a)->vertex->scc_index = 2 (unix_vertex_index_start)
  unix_sk(sk-x)->vertex->scc_index = 3

once gc completes, unix_graph_grouped is set to true.
also, unix_graph_maybe_cyclic is set to true due to sk-x's
cyclic self-reference, which makes close() trigger gc.

at 3-b, unix_add_edge() allocates unix_sk(sk-b)->vertex and
links it to unix_unvisited_vertices.

unix_update_graph() is called at 3-a. and 3-b., but neither
unix_graph_grouped nor unix_graph_maybe_cyclic is changed
because both sk-b's listener and sk-c are not in-flight.

3-c decrements sk-a's file refcnt to 1.

since unix_graph_grouped is true at 3-d, unix_walk_scc_fast()
is finally called and iterates 3 sockets sk-a, sk-b, and sk-x:

  sk-a -> sk-b (-> sk-c)
  sk-x -> sk-x

this is totally fine.  all of them are not yet close()d and
should be grouped into different sccs.

however, unix_vertex_dead() misjudges that sk-a and sk-b are
in the same scc and sk-a is dead.

  unix_sk(sk-a)->scc_index == unix_sk(sk-b)->scc_index <-- wrong!
  &&
  sk-a's file refcnt == unix_sk(sk-a)->vertex->out_degree
                                       ^-- 1 in-flight count for sk-b
  -> sk-a is dead !?

the problem is that unix_add_edge() does not initialise scc_index.

stage 1) is used for heap spraying, making a newly allocated
vertex have vertex->scc_index == 2 (unix_vertex_index_start)
set by unix_walk_scc() at 1-c.

let's track the max scc index from the previous unix_walk_scc()
call and assign the max + 1 to a new vertex's scc_index.

this way, we can continue to avoid tarjan's algorithm while
preventing misjudgments.">
