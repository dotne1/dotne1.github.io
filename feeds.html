                    <p>An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on PTX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause impact to confidentiality and availability.

When an output firewall filter is configured with one or moreÂ terms where the action is 'reject', packets matching these terms areÂ erroneously sent to the Routing Engine (RE) and further processed there.Â Processing of these packets will consume limited RE resources. Also responses from the RE back to the source of this traffic could reveal confidential information about the affected device.
This issue only applies to firewall filters applied to WAN or revenue interfaces, so not the mgmt or lo0 interface of the routing-engine, nor any input filters.

This issue affects Junos OS Evolved on PTX Series:

when a device isn't configured with a root password, an attacker can modify a specific file. it's contents will be added to the junos configuration of the device without being visible. this allows for the addition of any configuration unknown

this exploit is persistent across reboots and even zeroization.

the indicator of compromise is a modified /etc/config/<platform>-defaults[-flex].conf file. review that file for unexpected configuration statements, or compare it to an unmodified version which can beÂ extracted from the original juniper software image file. for details on the extraction procedure please contact juniper technical assistance center (jtac).
