                    <p>The Reales WP - Real Estate WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification and loss of data due to a missing capability check on the 'reales_delete_file', 'reales_delete_file_plans', 'reales_add_to_favourites', and 'reales_remove_from_favourites' functions in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary attachments, and add or remove favorite property listings for any user.</p>
