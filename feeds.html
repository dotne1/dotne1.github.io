the issue occurs because:

- usb9pfs_rx_complete() uses req->actual (actual received bytes) for
memcpy

this allows an attacker to craft packets with small declared size
(bypassing validation) but large actual payload (triggering overflow
in memcpy).

exceed the buffer capacity before copying data.">
