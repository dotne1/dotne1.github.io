the spyattribute connection option implemented by the datadirect connect for jdbc drivers, datadirect hybrid data pipeline jdbc driver and the datadirect openaccess jdbc driver log=(file) construct allows the user to specify an arbitrary file for the jdbc driver to write its log information to.  if an application allows an end user to specify a value for the spyattributes connection option then an attacker could cause java script to be written to a log file.  if the log file was in the correct location with the correct extension, an application server could see that log file as a resource to be served.  the attacker could fetch the resource from the server causing the java script to be executed.

                    <p>Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') vulnerability in Progress DataDirect Connect for JDBC drivers, Progress DataDirect Open Access JDBC driver and Hybrid Data Pipeline allows Remote Code Inclusion.

The SpyAttribute connection option implemented by the DataDirect Connect for JDBC drivers, DataDirect Hybrid Data Pipeline JDBC driver and the DataDirect OpenAccess JDBC driver log=(file) construct allows the user to specify an arbitrary file for the JDBC driver to write its log information to.  If an application allows an end user to specify a value for the SpyAttributes connection option then an attacker could cause java script to be written to a log file.  If the log file was in the correct location with the correct extension, an application server could see that log file as a resource to be served.  The attacker could fetch the resource from the server causing the java script to be executed.
