The pic parameter is decrypted using the sys_auth($pic, 1) function, which utilizes a hard-coded key Mc_Encryption_Key (bD2voYwPpNuJ7B8), defined in the db.php file. The decrypted URL is passed to the geturl() method, which uses cURL to make a request to the URL without proper security checks. An attacker can craft a malicious encrypted pic parameter, which, when decrypted, points to internal addresses or local file paths (such as http://127.0.0.1 or file://). By using the file:// protocol, the attacker can access arbitrary files on the local file system (e.g., file:///etc/passwd, file:///C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts), allowing them to read sensitive configuration files, log files, and more, leading to information leakage or system exposure.
