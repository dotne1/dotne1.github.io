                    <p>A Protection Mechanism Failure vulnerability in kernel filter processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker sending IPv6 traffic to an interface to effectively bypass any firewall filtering configured on the interface.

Due to an issue with Junos OS kernel filter processing, the 'payload-protocol' match is not being supported, causing any term containing it to accept all packets without taking any other action. In essence, these firewall filter terms were being processed as an 'accept' for all traffic on the interface.
