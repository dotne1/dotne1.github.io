the root cause is race condition as below:
- since it tries to remount rw filesystem, so that do_remount won't
call sb_prepare_remount_readonly to block fallocate, there may be race
condition in between remount and fallocate.
- in f2fs_remount(), default_options() will reset mount option to default
one, and then update it based on result of parse_options(), so there is
a hole which race condition can happen.

f2fs: don't reset unchangable mount option in f2fs_remount()

syzbot reports a bug as below:

The root cause is race condition as below:
- since it tries to remount rw filesystem, so that do_remount won't
call sb_prepare_remount_readonly to block fallocate, there may be race
condition in between remount and fallocate.
- in f2fs_remount(), default_options() will reset mount option to default
one, and then update it based on result of parse_options(), so there is
a hole which race condition can happen.
