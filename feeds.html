drm/amdgpu: fix null pointer dereference in vram logic for apu devices

previously, apu platforms (and other scenarios with uninitialized vram managers)
triggered a null pointer dereference in `ttm_resource_manager_usage()`. the root
cause is not that the `struct ttm_resource_manager *man` pointer itself is null,
but that `man->bdev` (the backing device pointer within the manager) remains
uninitialized (null) on apus—since apus lack dedicated vram and do not fully
set up vram manager structures. when `ttm_resource_manager_usage()` attempts to
acquire `man->bdev->lru_lock`, it dereferences the null `man->bdev`, leading to
a kernel oops.

1. **amdgpu_cs.c**: extend the existing bandwidth control check in
   `amdgpu_cs_get_threshold_for_moves()` to include a check for
   `ttm_resource_manager_used()`. if the manager is not used (uninitialized
   `bdev`), return 0 for migration thresholds immediately—skipping vram-specific
   logic that would trigger the null dereference.

2. **amdgpu_kms.c**: update the `amdgpu_info_vram_usage` ioctl and memory info
   reporting to use a conditional: if the manager is used, return the real vram
   usage; otherwise, return 0. this avoids accessing `man->bdev` when it is
   null.

3. **amdgpu_virt.c**: modify the vf2pf (virtual function to physical function)
   data write path. use `ttm_resource_manager_used()` to check validity: if the
   manager is usable, calculate `fb_usage` from vram usage; otherwise, set
   `fb_usage` to 0 (apus have no discrete framebuffer to report).

this approach is more robust than apu-specific checks because it:
- works for all scenarios where the vram manager is uninitialized (not just apus),
- aligns with ttm's design by using its native helper function,
- preserves correct behavior for discrete gpus (which have fully initialized
  `man->bdev` and pass the `ttm_resource_manager_used()` check).

v4: use ttm_resource_manager_used(&adev->mman.vram_mgr.manager) instead of checking the adev->gmc.is_app_apu flag (christian)">

alsa: usb-audio: fix null pointer dereference in snd_usb_mixer_controls_badd

in snd_usb_create_streams(), for uac version 3 devices, the interface
association descriptor (iad) is retrieved via usb_ifnum_to_if(). if this
call fails, a fallback routine attempts to obtain the iad from the next
interface and sets a badd profile. however, snd_usb_mixer_controls_badd()
assumes that the iad retrieved from usb_ifnum_to_if() is always valid,
without performing a null check. this can lead to a null pointer
dereference when usb_ifnum_to_if() fails to find the interface descriptor.

this patch adds a null pointer check after calling usb_ifnum_to_if() in
snd_usb_mixer_controls_badd() to prevent the dereference.

a crafted usb device descriptor.">

                    <p>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: guest_memfd: Remove bindings on memslot deletion when gmem is dying

When unbinding a memslot from a guest_memfd instance, remove the bindings
even if the guest_memfd file is dying, i.e. even if its file refcount has
gone to zero.  If the memslot is freed before the file is fully released,
nullifying the memslot side of the binding in kvm_gmem_release() will
write to freed memory, as detected by syzbot+KASAN:

nfsd: free copynotify stateid in nfs4_free_ol_stateid()

typically copynotify stateid is freed either when parent's stateid
is being close/freed or in nfsd4_laundromat if the stateid hasn't
been used in a lease period.

however, in case when the server got an open (which created
a parent stateid), followed by a copy_notify using that stateid,
followed by a client reboot. new client instance while doing
create_session would force expire previous state of this client.
it leads to the open state being freed thru release_openowner->
nfs4_free_ol_stateid() and it finds that it still has copynotify
stateid associated with it. we currently print a warning and is
triggerred

warning: cpu: 1 pid: 8858 at fs/nfsd/nfs4state.c:1550 nfs4_free_ol_stateid+0xb0/0x100 [nfsd]

this patch, instead, frees the associated copynotify stateid here.

if the parent stateid is freed (without freeing the copynotify
stateids associated with it), it leads to the list corruption
when laundromat ends up freeing the copynotify state later.

mm/secretmem: fix use-after-free race in fault handler

when a page fault occurs in a secret memory file created with
`memfd_secret(2)`, the kernel will allocate a new folio for it, mark the
underlying page as not-present in the direct map, and add it to the file
mapping.

if two tasks cause a fault in the same page concurrently, both could end
up allocating a folio and removing the page from the direct map, but only
one would succeed in adding the folio to the file mapping.  the task that
failed undoes the effects of its attempt by (a) freeing the folio again
and (b) putting the page back into the direct map.  however, by doing
these two operations in this order, the page becomes available to the
allocator again before it is placed back in the direct mapping.

if another task attempts to allocate the page between (a) and (b), and the
kernel tries to access it via the direct map, it would result in a
supervisor not-present page fault.

fix the ordering to restore the direct map before the folio is freed.">

fs/proc: fix uaf in proc_readdir_de()

pde is erased from subdir rbtree through rb_erase(), but not set the node
to empty, which may result in uaf access.  we should use rb_clear_node()
set the erased node to empty, then pde_subdir_next() will return null to
avoid uaf access.

we found an uaf issue while using stress-ng testing, need to run testcase
getdent and tun in the same time.  the steps of the issue is as follows:

1) use getdent to traverse dir /proc/pid/net/dev_snmp6/, and current
   pde is tun3;

2) in the [time windows] unregister netdevice tun3 and tun2, and erase
   them from rbtree.  erase tun3 first, and then erase tun2.  the
   pde(tun2) will be released to slab;

3) continue to getdent process, then pde_subdir_next() will return
   pde(tun2) which is released, it will case uaf access.

mm, swap: fix potential uaf issue for vma readahead

since commit 78524b05f1a3 ("mm, swap: avoid redundant swap device

swap cache layer no longer tries to get a swap device reference
internally, because all callers of __read_swap_cache_async are already
holding a swap entry reference.  the repeated swap device pinning isn't

caller of vma readahead is also holding a reference to the target entry's
swap device, but vma readahead walks the page table, so it might encounter
swap entries from other devices, and call __read_swap_cache_async on
another device without holding a reference to it.

so it is possible to cause a uaf when swapoff of device a raced with
swapin on device b, and vma readahead tries to read swap entries from
device a.  it's not easy to trigger, but in theory, it could cause real
issues.
