                    <p>A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in FNKvision FNK-GU2 up to 40.1.7. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /rom/wpa_supplicant.conf. The manipulation leads to cleartext storage of sensitive information. It is possible to launch the attack on the physical device. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.</p>
