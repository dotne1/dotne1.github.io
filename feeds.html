fix race condition where ptp periodic work runs while vsi is being
rebuilt, accessing null vsi->rx_rings.

the sequence was:
1. ice_ptp_prepare_for_reset() cancels ptp work
2. ice_ptp_rebuild() immediately queues ptp work
3. vsi rebuild happens after ice_ptp_rebuild()
4. ptp work runs and accesses null vsi->rx_rings

fix: keep ptp work cancelled during rebuild, only queue it after
vsi rebuild completes in ice_rebuild().

added ice_ptp_queue_work() helper function to encapsulate the logic
for queuing ptp work, ensuring it's only queued when ptp is supported
and the state is ice_ptp_ready.

macvlan: fix error recovery in macvlan_common_newlink()

valis provided a nice repro to crash the kernel:

ping -c1 -i p1 1.2.3.4

he also gave a very detailed analysis:

<quote valis>

the issue is triggered when a new macvlan link is created  with
macvlan_mode_source mode and macvlan_macaddr_add (or
macvlan_macaddr_set) parameter, lower device already has a macvlan
port and register_netdevice() called from macvlan_common_newlink()
fails (e.g. because of the invalid link name).

in this case macvlan_hash_add_source is called from
macvlan_change_sources() / macvlan_common_newlink():

this adds a reference to vlan to the port's vlan_source_hash using
macvlan_source_entry.

vlan is a pointer to the priv data of the link that is being created.

when register_netdevice() fails, the error is returned from
macvlan_newlink() to rtnl_newlink_create():

        if (ops->newlink)
                err = ops->newlink(dev, &params, extack);
        else
                err = register_netdevice(dev);
        if (err < 0) {
                free_netdev(dev);
                goto out;
        }

and free_netdev() is called, causing a kvfree() on the struct
net_device that is still referenced in the source entry attached to
the lower device's macvlan port.

now all packets sent on the macvlan port with a matching source mac
address will trigger a use-after-free in macvlan_forward_source().

</quote valis>

with all that, my fix is to make sure we call macvlan_flush_sources()
regardless of @create value whenever "goto destroy_macvlan_port;"
path is taken.
