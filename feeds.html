                    <p>A security flaw has been discovered in Sangfor Operation and Maintenance Security Management System up to 3.0.12. This affects the function edit_pwd_mall of the file /fort/login/edit_pwd_mall. The manipulation of the argument flag results in weak password recovery. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been released to the public and may be used for attacks. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.</p>
