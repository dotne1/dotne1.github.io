netfilter: nf_tables: fix inverted genmask check in nft_map_catchall_activate()

nft_map_catchall_activate() has an inverted element activity check
compared to its non-catchall counterpart nft_mapelem_activate() and
compared to what is logically required.

nft_map_catchall_activate() is called from the abort path to re-activate
catchall map elements that were deactivated during a failed transaction.
it should skip elements that are already active (they don't need
re-activation) and process elements that are inactive (they need to be
restored). instead, the current code does the opposite: it skips inactive
elements and processes active ones.

compare the non-catchall activate callback, which is correct:

  nft_mapelem_activate():
    if (nft_set_elem_active(ext, iter->genmask))
        return 0;   /* skip active, process inactive */

with the buggy catchall version:

  nft_map_catchall_activate():
    if (!nft_set_elem_active(ext, genmask))
        continue;   /* skip inactive, process active */

the consequence is that when a delset operation is aborted,
nft_setelem_data_activate() is never called for the catchall element.
for nft_goto verdict elements, this means nft_data_hold() is never
called to restore the chain->use reference count. each abort cycle
permanently decrements chain->use. once chain->use reaches zero,
delchain succeeds and frees the chain while catchall verdict elements
still reference it, resulting in a use-after-free.

this is exploitable for local privilege escalation from an unprivileged
user via user namespaces + nftables on distributions that enable
config_user_ns and config_nf_tables.

fix by removing the negation so the check matches nft_mapelem_activate():
skip active elements, process inactive ones.">
