posix-cpu-timers: fix race between handle_posix_cpu_timers() and posix_cpu_timer_del()

if an exiting non-autoreaping task has already passed exit_notify() and
calls handle_posix_cpu_timers() from irq, it can be reaped by its parent
or debugger right after unlock_task_sighand().

if a concurrent posix_cpu_timer_del() runs at that moment, it won't be
able to detect timer->it.cpu.firing != 0: cpu_timer_task_rcu() and/or
lock_task_sighand() will fail.

add the tsk->exit_state check into run_posix_cpu_timers() to fix this.

this fix is not needed if config_posix_cpu_timers_task_work=y, because
exit_task_work() is called before exit_notify(). but the check still
makes sense, task_work_add(&tsk->posix_cputimers_work.work) will fail
anyway in this case.">
