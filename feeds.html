                <div class="cve-entry" data-cve-id="CVE-2025-38351" data-description="in the linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

kvm: x86/hyper-v: skip non-canonical addresses during pv tlb flush

in kvm guests with hyper-v hypercalls enabled, the hypercalls
hvcall_flush_virtual_address_list and hvcall_flush_virtual_address_list_ex
allow a guest to request invalidation of portions of a virtual tlb.
for this, the hypercall parameter includes a list of gvas that are supposed
to be invalidated.

however, when non-canonical gvas are passed, there is currently no
filtering in place and they are eventually passed to checked invocations of
invvpid on intel / invlpga on amd.  while amd's invlpga silently ignores
non-canonical addresses (effectively a no-op), intel's invvpid explicitly
signals vm-fail and ultimately triggers the warn_once in invvpid_error():

  invvpid failed: ext=0x0 vpid=1 gva=0xaaaaaaaaaaaaa000
  warning: cpu: 6 pid: 326 at arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c:482

    kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+0x3013/0x5810 [kvm]

hyper-v documents that invalid gvas (those that are beyond a partition's
gva space) are to be ignored.  while not completely clear whether this
ruling also applies to non-canonical gvas, it is likely fine to make that
assumption, and manual testing on azure confirms "real" hyper-v interprets
the specification in the same way.

skip non-canonical gvas when processing the list of address to avoid
tripping the invvpid failure.  alternatively, kvm could filter out "bad"
gvas before inserting into the fifo, but practically speaking the only
downside of pushing validation to the final processing is that doing so
is suboptimal for the guest, and no well-behaved guest will request tlb
flushes for non-canonical addresses.">

                <div class="cve-entry" data-cve-id="CVE-2025-38350" data-description="in the linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: always pass notifications when child class becomes empty

certain classful qdiscs may invoke their classes' dequeue handler on an
enqueue operation. this may unexpectedly empty the child qdisc and thus
make an in-flight class passive via qlen_notify(). most qdiscs do not
expect such behaviour at this point in time and may re-activate the
class eventually anyways which will lead to a use-after-free.

the referenced fix commit attempted to fix this behavior for the hfsc
case by moving the backlog accounting around, though this turned out to
be incomplete since the parent's parent may run into the issue too.
the following reproducer demonstrates this use-after-free:

    tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: drr
    tc filter add dev lo parent 1: basic classid 1:1
    tc class add dev lo parent 1: classid 1:1 drr
    tc qdisc add dev lo parent 1:1 handle 2: hfsc def 1
    tc class add dev lo parent 2: classid 2:1 hfsc rt m1 8 d 1 m2 0
    tc qdisc add dev lo parent 2:1 handle 3: netem
    tc qdisc add dev lo parent 3:1 handle 4: blackhole

    echo 1 | socat -u stdin udp4-datagram:127.0.0.1:8888
    tc class delete dev lo classid 1:1
    echo 1 | socat -u stdin udp4-datagram:127.0.0.1:8888

since backlog accounting issues leading to a use-after-frees on stale
class pointers is a recurring pattern at this point, this patch takes
a different approach. instead of trying to fix the accounting, the patch
ensures that qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog always calls qlen_notify when
the child qdisc is empty. this solves the problem because deletion of
qdiscs always involves a call to qdisc_reset() and / or
qdisc_purge_queue() which ultimately resets its qlen to 0 thus causing
the following qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() to report to the parent. note
that this may call qlen_notify on passive classes multiple times. this
is not a problem after the recent patch series that made all the
classful qdiscs qlen_notify() handlers idempotent.">
