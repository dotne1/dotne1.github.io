                    <p>Description: VMware NSX contains a username enumeration vulnerability. An unauthenticated malicious actor may exploit this to enumerate valid usernames, potentially leading to unauthorized access attempts.


Impact: Username enumeration → facilitates unauthorized access.


Attack Vector: Remote, unauthenticated.


Severity: Important.


CVSSv3: 7.5 (High).


Acknowledgments: Reported by the National Security Agency.
