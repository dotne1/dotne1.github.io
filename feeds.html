can: hi311x: fix null pointer dereference when resuming from sleep before interface was enabled

this issue is similar to the vulnerability in the `mcp251x` driver,
which was fixed in commit 03c427147b2d ("can: mcp251x: fix resume from
sleep before interface was brought up").

in the `hi311x` driver, when the device resumes from sleep, the driver
schedules `priv->restart_work`. however, if the network interface was
not previously enabled, the `priv->wq` (workqueue) is not allocated and
initialized, leading to a null pointer dereference.

to fix this, we move the allocation and initialization of the workqueue
from the `hi3110_open` function to the `hi3110_can_probe` function.
this ensures that the workqueue is properly initialized before it is
used during device resume. and added logic to destroy the workqueue
in the error handling paths of `hi3110_can_probe` and in the
`hi3110_can_remove` function to prevent resource leaks.">
