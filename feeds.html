                    <p>Sflog! CMS 1.0 contains an authenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the blog management interface. The application ships with default credentials (admin:secret) and allows authenticated users to upload files via manage.php. The upload mechanism fails to validate file types, enabling attackers to upload a PHP backdoor into a web-accessible directory (blogs/download/uploads/). Once uploaded, the file can be executed remotely, resulting in full remote code execution.</p>
