                    <p>A vulnerability exists in QuickCMS version 6.8 where sensitive admin credentials are hardcoded in a configuration file and stored in plaintext. This flaw allows attackers with access to the source code or the server file system to retrieve authentication details, potentially leading to privilege escalation.

The vendor was notified early about this vulnerability, but didn't respond with the details of vulnerability or vulnerable version range. Only version 6.8 was tested and confirmed as vulnerable, other versions were not tested and might also be vulnerable.</p>
