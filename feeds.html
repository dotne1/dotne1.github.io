                    <p>A vulnerability was identified in Tenda AC23 16.03.07.52. This impacts the function fromSetIpMacBind of the file /goform/SetIpMacBind. Such manipulation of the argument bindnum leads to stack-based buffer overflow. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit is publicly available and might be used.</p>
