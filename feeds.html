                    <p>The Ubia camera ecosystem fails to adequately secure API credentials, 
potentially enabling an attacker to connect to backend services. The 
attacker would then be able to gain unauthorized access to available 
cameras, enabling the viewing of live feeds or modification of settings.</p>
