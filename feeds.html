the comedi_buf_munge() function performs a modulo operation
`async->munge_chan %= async->cmd.chanlist_len` without first
checking if chanlist_len is zero. if a user program submits a command with
chanlist_len set to zero, this causes a divide-by-zero error when the device
processes data in the interrupt handler path.

add a check for zero chanlist_len at the beginning of the
function, similar to the existing checks for !map and
cmdf_rawdata flag. when chanlist_len is zero, update
munge_count and return early, indicating the data was
handled without munging.

this prevents potential kernel panics from malformed user commands.">
