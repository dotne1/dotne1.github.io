                    <p>A vulnerability was determined in Linksys RE6250, RE6300, RE6350, RE6500, RE7000 and RE9000 1.0.013.001/1.0.04.001/1.0.04.002/1.1.05.003/1.2.07.001. This issue affects the function cgiMain of the file /cgi-bin/upload.cgi. Executing manipulation of the argument filename can lead to os command injection. The attack may be performed from a remote location. The exploit has been publicly disclosed and may be utilized. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.</p>
