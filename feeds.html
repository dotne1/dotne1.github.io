a vulnerability has been identified in the orc c++ lzo decompression logic, where specially crafted malformed orc files can cause the decompressor to allocate a 250-byte buffer but then attempts to copy 295 bytes into it. it causes memory corruption.

this issue affects apache orc c++ library: through 1.8.8, from 1.9.0 through 1.9.5, from 2.0.0 through 2.0.4, from 2.1.0 through 2.1.1.
