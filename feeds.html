                    <p>The FileBird – WordPress Media Library Folders & File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to missing authorization in all versions up to, and including, 6.5.1 via the "ConvertController::insertToNewTable" function due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author level access and above, to inject global folders and reassign arbitrary media attachments to those folders under certain circumstances.</p>
