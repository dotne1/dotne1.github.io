An attacker could exploit this by setting a crafted `x-sendfile-type: x-accel-redirect` header, setting a crafted `x-accel-mapping` header, and requesting a path that qualifies for proxy-based acceleration.

                    <p>ReNgine thru 2.2.0 is vulnerable to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Vulnerabilities module. When scanning a target with an XSS payload, the unsanitized payload is rendered in the ReNgine web UI, resulting in arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser. This can be abused to steal session cookies, perform unauthorized actions, or compromise the ReNgine administrator's account.</p>
