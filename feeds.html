                    <p>CVE-2025-54085 is a vulnerability in the management console
of Absolute Secure Access prior to version 13.56. Attackers with administrative
access to the console and who have been assigned a certain set of permissions
can bypass those permissions to improperly read or change other settings. The
attack complexity is low, there are no preexisting attack requirements; the
privileges required are high, and there is no user interaction required. The
impact to system confidentiality and integrity is low, there is no impact to
system availability.</p>
