iommu/amd/pgtbl: fix possible race while increase page table level

the amd iommu host page table implementation supports dynamic page table levels
(up to 6 levels), starting with a 3-level configuration that expands based on
iova address. the kernel maintains a root pointer and current page table level
to enable proper page table walks in alloc_pte()/fetch_pte() operations.

the iommu iova allocator initially starts with 32-bit address and onces its
exhuasted it switches to 64-bit address (max address is determined based
on iommu and device dma capability). to support larger iova, amd iommu
driver increases page table level.

but in unmap path (iommu_v1_unmap_pages()), fetch_pte() reads
pgtable->[root/mode] without lock. so its possible that in exteme corner case,
when increase_address_space() is updating pgtable->[root/mode], fetch_pte()
reads wrong page table level (pgtable->mode). it does compare the value with
level encoded in page table and returns null. this will result is
iommu_unmap ops to fail and upper layer may retry/log warn_on.

iommu/s390: make attach succeed when the device was surprise removed

when a pci device is removed with surprise hotplug, there may still be
attempts to attach the device to the default domain as part of tear down
via (__iommu_release_dma_ownership()), or because the removal happens
during probe (__iommu_probe_device()). in both cases zpci_register_ioat()
fails with a cc value indicating that the device handle is invalid. this
is because the device is no longer part of the instance as far as the
hypervisor is concerned.

currently this leads to an error return and s390_iommu_attach_device()
fails. this triggers the warn_on() in __iommu_group_set_domain_nofail()
because attaching to the default domain must never fail.

with the device fenced by the hypervisor no dmas to or from memory are
possible and the iommu translations have no effect. proceed as if the
registration was successful and let the hotplug event handling clean up
the device.

this is similar to how devices in the error state are handled since
commit 59bbf596791b ("iommu/s390: make attach succeed even if the device
is in error state") except that for removal the domain will not be
registered later. this approach was also previously discussed at the
link.

handle both cases, error state and removal, in a helper which checks if
the error needs to be propagated or ignored. avoid magic number
condition codes by using the pre-existing, but never used, defines for
pci load/store condition codes and rename them to reflect that they
apply to all pci instructions.">
