this insecure default allows an attacker with network level access to completely control the whole environment. an attacker is for example easily able to conduct the following tasks without prior authentication:
- re-configure access managers (e.g. remove alarming system requirements)
- freely re-configure the inputs and outputs
- open all connected doors permanently
- open all doors for a defined time interval
- change the admin password
- and many more

network level access can be gained due to an insufficient network segmentation as well as missing lan firewalls. devices with an insecure configuration have been identified to be directly exposed to the internet.">
