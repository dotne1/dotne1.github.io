net/sched: sch_cake: fix incorrect qlen reduction in cake_drop

in cake_drop(), qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() is used to update the qlen
and backlog of the qdisc hierarchy. its caller, cake_enqueue(), assumes
that the parent qdisc will enqueue the current packet. however, this
assumption breaks when cake_enqueue() returns net_xmit_cn: the parent
qdisc stops enqueuing current packet, leaving the tree qlen/backlog
accounting inconsistent. this mismatch can lead to a null dereference
(e.g., when the parent qdisc is qfq_qdisc).

this patch computes the qlen/backlog delta in a more robust way by
observing the difference before and after the series of cake_drop()
calls, and then compensates the qdisc tree accounting if cake_enqueue()
returns net_xmit_cn.

to ensure correct compensation when ack thinning is enabled, a new

                    <p>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: sch_cake: Fix incorrect qlen reduction in cake_drop

In cake_drop(), qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() is used to update the qlen
and backlog of the qdisc hierarchy. Its caller, cake_enqueue(), assumes
that the parent qdisc will enqueue the current packet. However, this
assumption breaks when cake_enqueue() returns NET_XMIT_CN: the parent
qdisc stops enqueuing current packet, leaving the tree qlen/backlog
accounting inconsistent. This mismatch can lead to a NULL dereference
(e.g., when the parent Qdisc is qfq_qdisc).

This patch computes the qlen/backlog delta in a more robust way by
observing the difference before and after the series of cake_drop()
calls, and then compensates the qdisc tree accounting if cake_enqueue()
returns NET_XMIT_CN.

To ensure correct compensation when ACK thinning is enabled, a new
variable is introduced to keep qlen unchanged.</p>
