xfrm: interface: fix use-after-free after changing collect_md xfrm interface

collect_md property on xfrm interfaces can only be set on device creation,
thus xfrmi_changelink() should fail when called on such interfaces.

the check to enforce this was done only in the case where the xi was
returned from xfrmi_locate() which doesn't look for the collect_md
interface, and thus the validation was never reached.

calling changelink would thus errornously place the special interface xi
in the xfrmi_net->xfrmi hash, but since it also exists in the
xfrmi_net->collect_md_xfrmi pointer it would lead to a double free when
the net namespace was taken down [1].

change the check to use the xi from netdev_priv which is available earlier
in the function to prevent changes in xfrm collect_md interfaces.
