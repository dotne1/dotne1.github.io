when using htmllayout, logger names are not properly escaped when writing out to the html file.
if untrusted data is used to retrieve the name of a logger, an attacker could theoretically inject html or javascript in order to hide information from logs or steal data from the user.
in order to activate this, the following sequence must occur:



  *  log4cxx is configured to use htmllayout.

  *  logger name comes from an untrusted string

  *  logger with compromised name logs a message

  *  user opens the generated html log file in their browser, leading to potential xss


because logger names are generally constant strings, we assess the impact to users as low
