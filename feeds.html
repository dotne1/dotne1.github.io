s390/ism: fix concurrency management in ism_cmd()

the s390x ism device data sheet clearly states that only one
request-response sequence is allowable per ism function at any point in
time.  unfortunately as of today the s390/ism driver in linux does not
honor that requirement. this patch aims to rectify that.

this problem was discovered based on aliaksei's bug report which states
that for certain workloads the ism functions end up entering error state
(with pec 2 as seen from the logs) after a while and as a consequence
connections handled by the respective function break, and for future
connection requests the ism device is not considered -- given it is in a
dysfunctional state. during further debugging pec 3a was observed as
well.

a kernel message like
[ 1211.244319] zpci: 061a:00:00.0: event 0x2 reports an error for pci function 0x61a
is a reliable indicator of the stated function entering error state
with pec 2. let me also point out that a kernel message like
[ 1211.244325] zpci: 061a:00:00.0: the ism driver bound to the device does not support error recovery
is a reliable indicator that the ism function won't be auto-recovered
because the ism driver currently lacks support for it.

on a technical level, without this synchronization, commands (inputs to
the fw) may be partially or fully overwritten (corrupted) by another cpu
trying to issue commands on the same function. there is hard evidence that
this can lead to dmb token values being used as dmb iovas, leading to
pec 2 pci events indicating invalid dma. but this is only one of the
failure modes imaginable. in theory even completely losing one command
and executing another one twice and then trying to interpret the outputs
as if the command we intended to execute was actually executed and not
the other one is also possible.  frankly, i don't feel confident about
providing an exhaustive list of possible consequences.">

serial: 8250: fix panic due to pslverr

when the pslverr_resp_en parameter is set to 1, the device generates
an error response if an attempt is made to read an empty rbr (receive
buffer register) while the fifo is enabled.

in serial8250_do_startup(), calling serial_port_out(port, uart_lcr,
uart_lcr_wlen8) triggers dw8250_check_lcr(), which invokes
dw8250_force_idle() and serial8250_clear_and_reinit_fifos(). the latter
function enables the fifo via serial_out(p, uart_fcr, p->fcr).
execution proceeds to the serial_port_in(port, uart_rx).
this satisfies the pslverr trigger condition.

when another cpu (e.g., using printk()) is accessing the uart (uart
is busy), the current cpu fails the check (value & ~uart_lcr_spar) ==
(lcr & ~uart_lcr_spar) in dw8250_check_lcr(), causing it to enter
dw8250_force_idle().

put serial_port_out(port, uart_lcr, uart_lcr_wlen8) under the port->lock

netfs: fix unbuffered write error handling

if all the subrequests in an unbuffered write stream fail, the subrequest
collector doesn't update the stream->transferred value and it retains its
initial long_max value.  unfortunately, if all active streams fail, then we
take the smallest value of { long_max, long_max, ... } as the value to set
in wreq->transferred - which is then returned from ->write_iter().

long_max was chosen as the initial value so that all the streams can be
quickly assessed by taking the smallest value of all stream->transferred -
but this only works if we've set any of them.

fix this by adding a flag to indicate whether the value in
stream->transferred is valid and checking that when we integrate the
values.  stream->transferred can then be initialised to zero.

this was found by running the generic/750 xfstest against cifs with
cache=none.  it splices data to the target file.  once (if) it has used up
all the available scratch space, the writes start failing with enospc.
this causes ->write_iter() to fail.  however, it was returning
wreq->transferred, i.e. long_max, rather than an error (because it thought
the amount transferred was non-zero) and iter_file_splice_write() would
then try to clean up that amount of pipe bufferage - leading to an oops

also reserves access to register page 0 suspend operations cannot touch

this is similar to when running optee, where optee will reserve page 0.

track this situation using a new state variable no_page0, reflecting if
page 0 is reserved elsewhere, either by other management cores in soc or

replace the optee_en check in suspend/resume with the new check.

optee_en cannot go away as it's needed elsewhere to gate optee specific

                    <p>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: caam - Prevent crash on suspend with iMX8QM / iMX8ULP

Since the CAAM on these SoCs is managed by another ARM core, called the
SECO (Security Controller) on iMX8QM and Secure Enclave on iMX8ULP, which
also reserves access to register page 0 suspend operations cannot touch
this page.

This is similar to when running OPTEE, where OPTEE will reserve page 0.

Track this situation using a new state variable no_page0, reflecting if
page 0 is reserved elsewhere, either by other management cores in SoC or
by OPTEE.

Replace the optee_en check in suspend/resume with the new check.

optee_en cannot go away as it's needed elsewhere to gate OPTEE specific
situations.

Fixes the following splat at suspend:

crypto: qat - flush misc workqueue during device shutdown

repeated loading and unloading of a device specific qat driver, for
example qat_4xxx, in a tight loop can lead to a crash due to a
use-after-free scenario. this occurs when a power management (pm)
interrupt triggers just before the device-specific driver (e.g.,
qat_4xxx.ko) is unloaded, while the core driver (intel_qat.ko) remains
loaded.

since the driver uses a shared workqueue (`qat_misc_wq`) across all
devices and owned by intel_qat.ko, a deferred routine from the
device-specific driver may still be pending in the queue. if this
routine executes after the driver is unloaded, it can dereference freed
memory, resulting in a page fault and kernel crash like the following:

workqueue contains jobs from other devices, but it ensures correctness
and stability.">

media: rainshadow-cec: fix toctou race condition in rain_interrupt()

in the interrupt handler rain_interrupt(), the buffer full check on
rain->buf_len is performed before acquiring rain->buf_lock. this
creates a time-of-check to time-of-use (toctou) race condition, as
rain->buf_len is concurrently accessed and modified in the work
handler rain_irq_work_handler() under the same lock.

multiple interrupt invocations can race, with each reading buf_len
before it becomes full and then proceeding. this can lead to both
interrupts attempting to write to the buffer, incrementing buf_len
beyond its capacity (data_size) and causing a buffer overflow.

fix this bug by moving the spin_lock() to before the buffer full
check. this ensures that the check and the subsequent buffer modification
are performed atomically, preventing the race condition. an corresponding
spin_unlock() is added to the overflow path to correctly release the
lock.

this possible bug was found by an experimental static analysis tool
developed by our team.">

media: ivsc: fix crash at shutdown due to missing mei_cldev_disable() calls

both the ace and csi driver are missing a mei_cldev_disable() call in

list even though its memory is freed by mei_cl_bus_dev_release() calling
kfree(cldev->cl).

this leads to a use-after-free when mei_vsc_remove() runs mei_stop()

mei_cl_all_disconnect() which walks over mei_device->file_list dereferecing
