nfsd: fix refcount leak in nfsd_set_fh_dentry()

nfsd exports a "pseudo root filesystem" which is used by nfsv4 to find
the various exported filesystems using lookup requests from a known root
filehandle.  nfsv3 uses the mount protocol to find those exported
filesystems and so is not given access to the pseudo root filesystem.

if a v3 (or v2) client uses a filehandle from that filesystem,
nfsd_set_fh_dentry() will report an error, but still stores the export
in "struct svc_fh" even though it also drops the reference (exp_put()).
this means that when fh_put() is called an extra reference will be dropped
which can lead to use-after-free and possible denial of service.

normal nfs usage will not provide a pseudo-root filehandle to a v3
client.  this bug can only be triggered by the client synthesising an
incorrect filehandle.

to fix this we move the assignments to the svc_fh later, after all
possible error cases have been detected.">
