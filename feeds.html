                    <p>Weblate is a web based localization tool. In versions prior to 5.15, it was possible to trigger repository updates for many repositories via a crafted webhook payload. Version 5.15 fixes the issue. As a workaround, disabling webhooks completely using ENABLE_HOOKS avoids this vulnerability.</p>
