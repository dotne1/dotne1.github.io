root cause:
the brpc json2pb component uses rapidjson to parse json data from the network. the rapidjson parser uses a recursive parsing method by default. if the input json has a large depth of recursive structure, the parser function may run into stack overflow.

affected scenarios:
use brpc server with protobuf message to serve http+json requests from untrusted network. or directly use jsontoprotomessage to convert json from untrusted input.



how to fix: 
(choose one of the following options) 
1. upgrade brpc to version 1.15.0, which fixes this issue.
2. apply this patch:  https://github.com/apache/brpc/pull/3099 



note:
no matter which option 

you choose, you should know that the fix introduces a recursion depth limit with default value 100. it affects these functions: 

protomessagetojson, protomessagetoprotojson, jsontoprotomessage, and protojsontoprotomessage.

 if your requests contain json or protobuf messages that have a depth exceeding the limit, the request will be failed after applying the fix. you can modify the gflag json2pb_max_recursion_depth to change the limit.">
