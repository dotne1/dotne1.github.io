client where the req_list could be deleted simultaneously by both
p9_read_work and p9_fd_cancelled functions, but for the case where req->status

update the check for req->status in p9_fd_cancelled to skip processing not

changed the state from sent also removed the request from its list.

kvm: x86: don't (re)check l1 intercepts when completing userspace i/o

when completing emulation of instruction that generated a userspace exit
for i/o, don't recheck l1 intercepts as kvm has already finished that
phase of instruction execution, i.e. has already committed to allowing l2
to perform i/o.  if l1 (or host userspace) modifies the i/o permission
bitmaps during the exit to userspace,  kvm will treat the access as being
intercepted despite already having emulated the i/o access.

pivot on emultype_no_decode to detect that kvm is completing emulation.
of the three users of emultype_no_decode, only complete_emulated_io() (the
intended "recipient") can reach the code in question.  gp_interception()'s
use is mutually exclusive with is_guest_mode(), and
complete_emulated_insn_gp() unconditionally pairs emultype_no_decode with
emultype_skip.

the bad behavior was detected by a syzkaller program that toggles port i/o
interception during the userspace i/o exit, ultimately resulting in a warn
on vcpu->arch.pio.count being non-zero due to kvm no completing emulation
of the i/o instruction.

                    <p>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: x86: Don't (re)check L1 intercepts when completing userspace I/O

When completing emulation of instruction that generated a userspace exit
for I/O, don't recheck L1 intercepts as KVM has already finished that
phase of instruction execution, i.e. has already committed to allowing L2
to perform I/O.  If L1 (or host userspace) modifies the I/O permission
bitmaps during the exit to userspace,  KVM will treat the access as being
intercepted despite already having emulated the I/O access.

Pivot on EMULTYPE_NO_DECODE to detect that KVM is completing emulation.
Of the three users of EMULTYPE_NO_DECODE, only complete_emulated_io() (the
intended "recipient") can reach the code in question.  gp_interception()'s
use is mutually exclusive with is_guest_mode(), and
complete_emulated_insn_gp() unconditionally pairs EMULTYPE_NO_DECODE with
EMULTYPE_SKIP.

The bad behavior was detected by a syzkaller program that toggles port I/O
interception during the userspace I/O exit, ultimately resulting in a WARN
on vcpu->arch.pio.count being non-zero due to KVM no completing emulation
of the I/O instruction.

w/ a fuzzed image, f2fs may encounter panic due to it detects inconsistent
truncation range in direct node in f2fs_truncate_hole().

the root cause is: a non-inode dnode may has the same footer.ino and
footer.nid, so the dnode will be parsed as an inode, then addrs_per_page()
may return wrong blkaddr count which may be 923 typically, by chance,
dn.ofs_in_node is equal to 923, then count can be calculated to 0 in below
statement, later it will trigger panic w/ f2fs_bug_on(, count == 0 || ...).

	count = min(end_offset - dn.ofs_in_node, pg_end - pg_start);

this patch introduces a new node_type node_type_non_inode, then allowing
passing the new_type to sanity_check_node_footer in f2fs_get_node_folio()
to detect corruption that a non-inode dnode has the same footer.ino and
footer.nid.
