vmxnet3: fix packet corruption in vmxnet3_xdp_xmit_frame

andrew and nikolay reported connectivity issues with cilium's service
load-balancing in case of vmxnet3.

if a bpf program for native xdp adds an encapsulation header such as
ipip and transmits the packet out the same interface, then in case
of vmxnet3 a corrupted packet is being sent and subsequently dropped
on the path.

vmxnet3_xdp_xmit_frame() which is called e.g. via vmxnet3_run_xdp()
through vmxnet3_xdp_xmit_back() calculates an incorrect dma address:

  page = virt_to_page(xdpf->data);
  tbi->dma_addr = page_pool_get_dma_addr(page) +
                  vmxnet3_xdp_headroom;

                             dma_to_device);

the above assumes a fixed offset (vmxnet3_xdp_headroom), but the xdp
bpf program could have moved xdp->data. while the passed buf_size is
correct (xdpf->len), the dma_addr needs to have a dynamic offset which
can be calculated as xdpf->data - (void *)xdpf, that is, xdp->data -
xdp->data_hard_start.">

                    <p>libsnowflakeclient is the Snowflake Connector for C/C++. Versions starting from 0.5.0 to before 2.2.0, incorrectly treat malformed requests that caused the HTTP response status code 400, as able to be retried. This could hang the application until SF_CON_MAX_RETRY requests were sent. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.0.</p>
