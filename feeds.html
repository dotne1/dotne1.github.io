this vulnerability is a confirmed http response splitting flaw in cgi::simple that allows http response header injection, which can be used for reflected xss or open redirect under certain conditions.

although some validation exists, it can be bypassed using url-encoded values, allowing an attacker to inject untrusted content into the response via query parameters.



as a result, an attacker can inject a line break (e.g. %0a) into the parameter value, causing the server to split the http response and inject arbitrary headers or even an html/javascript body, leading to reflected cross-site scripting (xss), open redirect or other attacks.

the issue documented in cve-2010-4410 https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=cve-2010-4410 is related but the fix was incomplete.

by injecting %0a (newline) into a query string parameter, an attacker can:

  *  inject a new header or entire body
  *  deliver a script payload that is reflected in the server’s response
