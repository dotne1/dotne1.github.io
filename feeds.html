                    <p>Greenshot is an open source Windows screenshot utility. Greenshot 1.3.300 and earlier deserializes attacker-controlled data received in a WM_COPYDATA message using BinaryFormatter.Deserialize without prior validation or authentication, allowing a local process at the same integrity level to trigger arbitrary code execution inside the Greenshot process. The vulnerable logic resides in a WinForms WndProc handler for WM_COPYDATA (message 74) that copies the supplied bytes into a MemoryStream and invokes BinaryFormatter.Deserialize, and only afterward checks whether the specified channel is authorized. Because the authorization check occurs after deserialization, any gadget chain embedded in the serialized payload executes regardless of channel membership. A local attacker who can send WM_COPYDATA to the Greenshot main window can achieve in-process code execution, which may aid evasion of application control policies by running payloads within the trusted, signed Greenshot.exe process. This issue is fixed in version 1.3.301. No known workarounds exist.</p>

read of size 4 at addr ffff000128f66e0c by task syz-executor.2/29371

fix this by increasing the stack buffer to also include room for
the extra sequence numbers and all the known dccp packet type headers,
then pull again after the initial validation of the basic header.

while at it, mark packets invalid that lack 48bit sequence bit but
where rfc says the type must use them.

compile tested only.

v2: first skb_header_pointer() now needs to adjust the size to
    only pull the generic header. (eric)
