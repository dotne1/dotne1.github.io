hid: appletb-kbd: fix "appletb_backlight" backlight device reference counting

during appletb_kbd_probe, probe attempts to get the backlight device
by name. when this happens backlight_device_get_by_name looks for a
device in the backlight class which has name "appletb_backlight" and
upon finding a match it increments the reference count for the device
and returns it to the caller. however this reference is never released
leading to a reference leak.

fix this by decrementing the backlight device reference count on removal
via put_device and on probe failure.">
