                    <p>A vulnerability has been identified in SCALANCE LPE9403 (6GK5998-3GS00-2AC2) (All versions). Affected devices do not properly validate incoming Profinet packets.
An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this flaw by sending a specially crafted malicious packet, which leads to a crash of the dcpd
process.</p>
