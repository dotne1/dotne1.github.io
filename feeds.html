                    <p>A vulnerability exists in Keycloak's server distribution where enabling debug mode (--debug <port>) insecurely defaults to binding the Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) port to all network interfaces (0.0.0.0). This exposes the debug port to the local network, allowing an attacker on the same network segment to attach a remote debugger and achieve remote code execution within the Keycloak Java virtual machine.</p>
