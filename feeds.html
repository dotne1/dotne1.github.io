bpf: check changes_pkt_data property for extension programs

bpf: track changes_pkt_data property for global functions

when processing calls to certain helpers, verifier invalidates all
packet pointers in a current state. for example, consider the
following program:

    __attribute__((__noinline__))
    long skb_pull_data(struct __sk_buff *sk, __u32 len)
    {
        return bpf_skb_pull_data(sk, len);
    }

    sec("tc")
    int test_invalidate_checks(struct __sk_buff *sk)
    {
        int *p = (void *)(long)sk->data;
        if ((void *)(p + 1) > (void *)(long)sk->data_end) return tcx_drop;
        skb_pull_data(sk, 0);
        *p = 42;
        return tcx_pass;
    }

after a call to bpf_skb_pull_data() the pointer 'p' can't be used
safely. see function filter.c:bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data() for a list
of such helpers.

at the moment verifier invalidates packet pointers when processing
helper function calls, and does not traverse global sub-programs when
processing calls to global sub-programs. this means that calls to
helpers done from global sub-programs do not invalidate pointers in
the caller state. e.g. the program above is unsafe, but is not
rejected by verifier.

this commit fixes the omission by computing field
bpf_subprog_info->changes_pkt_data for each sub-program before main
verification pass.
changes_pkt_data should be set if:
- subprogram calls helper for which bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data
  returns true;
- subprogram calls a global function,
  for which bpf_subprog_info->changes_pkt_data should be set.

the verifier.c:check_cfg() pass is modified to compute this
information. the commit relies on depth first instruction traversal
done by check_cfg() and absence of recursive function calls:
- check_cfg() would eventually visit every call to subprogram s in a
  state when s is fully explored;
- when s is fully explored:
  - every direct helper call within s is explored
    (and thus changes_pkt_data is set if needed);
  - every call to subprogram s1 called by s was visited with s1 fully
    explored (and thus s inherits changes_pkt_data from s1).

the downside of such approach is that dead code elimination is not
taken into account: if a helper call inside global function is dead
because of current configuration, verifier would conservatively assume
that the call occurs for the purpose of the changes_pkt_data
computation.">
