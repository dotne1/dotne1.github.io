the problem stems from the fact that ch9200_mdio_read()

to fix this we should check the return value of

mm/hugetlb: fix huge_pmd_unshare() vs gup-fast race

huge_pmd_unshare() drops a reference on a page table that may have
previously been shared across processes, potentially turning it into a
normal page table used in another process in which unrelated vmas can
afterwards be installed.

if this happens in the middle of a concurrent gup_fast(), gup_fast() could
end up walking the page tables of another process.  while i don't see any
way in which that immediately leads to kernel memory corruption, it is
really weird and unexpected.

mm/hugetlb: unshare page tables during vma split, not before

currently, __split_vma() triggers hugetlb page table unsharing through
vm_ops->may_split().  this happens before the vma lock and rmap locks are
taken - which is too early, it allows racing vma-locked page faults in our
process and racing rmap walks from other processes to cause page tables to
be shared again before we actually perform the split.

fix it by explicitly calling into the hugetlb unshare logic from
__split_vma() in the same place where thp splitting also happens.  at that
point, both the vma and the rmap(s) are write-locked.

an annoying detail is that we can now call into the helper
hugetlb_unshare_pmds() from two different locking contexts:

1. from hugetlb_split(), holding:
    - mmap lock (exclusively)
    - vma lock
    - file rmap lock (exclusively)
2. hugetlb_unshare_all_pmds(), which i think is designed to be able to
   call us with only the mmap lock held (in shared mode), but currently
   only runs while holding mmap lock (exclusively) and vma lock

backporting note:
this commit fixes a racy protection that was introduced in commit
b30c14cd6102 ("hugetlb: unshare some pmds when splitting vmas"); that
commit claimed to fix an issue introduced in 5.13, but it should actually
also go all the way back.
