bpf: fix oob access in cgroup local storage

lonial reported that an out-of-bounds access in cgroup local storage
can be crafted via tail calls. given two programs each utilizing a
cgroup local storage with a different value size, and one program
doing a tail call into the other. the verifier will validate each of
the indivial programs just fine. however, in the runtime context
the bpf_cg_run_ctx holds an bpf_prog_array_item which contains the
bpf program as well as any cgroup local storage flavor the program
uses. helpers such as bpf_get_local_storage() pick this up from the
runtime context:

  ctx = container_of(current->bpf_ctx, struct bpf_cg_run_ctx, run_ctx);
  storage = ctx->prog_item->cgroup_storage[stype];

  if (stype == bpf_cgroup_storage_shared)
    ptr = &read_once(storage->buf)->data[0];
  else
    ptr = this_cpu_ptr(storage->percpu_buf);

for the second program which was called from the originally attached
one, this means bpf_get_local_storage() will pick up the former
program's map, not its own. with mismatching sizes, this can result
in an unintended out-of-bounds access.

to fix this issue, we need to extend bpf_map_owner with an array of
storage_cookie[] to match on i) the exact maps from the original
program if the second program was using bpf_get_local_storage(), or
ii) allow the tail call combination if the second program was not
using any of the cgroup local storage maps.">
