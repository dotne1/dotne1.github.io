acpi: video: fix use-after-free in acpi_video_switch_brightness()

the switch_brightness_work delayed work accesses device->brightness
and device->backlight, freed by acpi_video_dev_unregister_backlight()
during device removal.

if the work executes after acpi_video_bus_unregister_backlight()
frees these resources, it causes a use-after-free when
acpi_video_switch_brightness() dereferences device->brightness or
device->backlight.

fix this by calling cancel_delayed_work_sync() for each device's
switch_brightness_work in acpi_video_bus_remove_notify_handler()
after removing the notify handler that queues the work. this ensures
the work completes before the memory is freed.

i've found that pynfs comp6 now leaves the connection or lease in a

however, i bisected to commit 48aab1606fa8 ("nfsd: remove the cap on

tianshuo han also reports a potential vulnerability when decoding
an nfsv4 compound. an attacker can place an arbitrarily large op

btrfs: fix memory leak of qgroup_list in btrfs_add_qgroup_relation

when btrfs_add_qgroup_relation() is called with invalid qgroup levels
(src >= dst), the function returns -einval directly without freeing the
preallocated qgroup_list structure passed by the caller. this causes a
memory leak because the caller unconditionally sets the pointer to null
after the call, preventing any cleanup.

the issue occurs because the level validation check happens before the
mutex is acquired and before any error handling path that would free
the prealloc pointer. on this early return, the cleanup code at the
'out' label (which includes kfree(prealloc)) is never reached.

in btrfs_ioctl_qgroup_assign(), the code pattern is:

    prealloc = kzalloc(sizeof(*prealloc), gfp_kernel);
    ret = btrfs_add_qgroup_relation(trans, sa->src, sa->dst, prealloc);
    prealloc = null;  // always set to null regardless of return value
    ...
    kfree(prealloc);  // this becomes kfree(null), does nothing

when the level check fails, 'prealloc' is never freed by either the
callee or the caller, resulting in a 64-byte memory leak per failed
operation. this can be triggered repeatedly by an unprivileged user
with access to a writable btrfs mount, potentially exhausting kernel
memory.

fix this by freeing prealloc before the early return, ensuring prealloc
is always freed on all error paths.">
