                    <p>A vulnerability in the ObsidianReader class of the run-llama/llama_index repository, specifically in version 0.12.27, allows for hardlink-based path traversal. This flaw permits attackers to bypass path restrictions and access sensitive system files, such as /etc/passwd, by exploiting hardlinks. The vulnerability arises from inadequate handling of hardlinks in the load_data() method, where the security checks fail to differentiate between real files and hardlinks. This issue is resolved in version 0.5.2.</p>
