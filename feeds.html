affected spring products and versions

spring framework:
  *  6.2.0 - 6.2.6

  *  6.1.0 - 6.1.19

  *  6.0.0 - 6.0.27

  *  5.3.0 - 5.3.42
  *  older, unsupported versions are also affected



mitigation

users of affected versions should upgrade to the corresponding fixed version.

no further mitigation steps are necessary.


generally, we recommend using a dedicated model object with properties only for data binding, or using constructor binding since constructor arguments explicitly declare what to bind together with turning off setter binding through the declarativebinding flag. see the model design section in the reference documentation.

for setting binding, prefer the use of allowedfields (an explicit list) over disallowedfields.
