net/sched: restrict conditions for adding duplicating netems to qdisc tree

netem_enqueue's duplication prevention logic breaks when a netem
resides in a qdisc tree with other netems - this can lead to a
soft lockup and oom loop in netem_dequeue, as seen in [1].
ensure that a duplicating netem cannot exist in a tree with other
netems.

previous approaches suggested in discussions in chronological order:

1) track duplication status or ttl in the sk_buff struct. considered
too specific a use case to extend such a struct, though this would
be a resilient fix and address other previous and potential future
dos bugs like the one described in loopy fun [2].

2) restrict netem_enqueue recursion depth like in act_mirred with a
per cpu variable. however, netem_dequeue can call enqueue on its
child, and the depth restriction could be bypassed if the child is a
netem.

3) use the same approach as in 2, but add metadata in netem_skb_cb
to handle the netem_dequeue case and track a packet's involvement
in duplication. this is an overly complex approach, and jamal
notes that the skb cb can be overwritten to circumvent this
safeguard.

4) prevent the addition of a netem to a qdisc tree if its ancestral
path contains a netem. however, filters and actions can cause a
packet to change paths when re-enqueued to the root from netem
duplication, leading us to the current solution: prevent a
duplicating netem from inhabiting the same tree as other netems.
