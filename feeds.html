cloudflare quiche was discovered to be vulnerable to incorrect congestion window growth, which could cause it to send data at a rate faster than the path might actually support.

an unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by first completing a handshake and initiating a congestion-controlled data transfer towards itself. then, it could manipulate the victim's congestion control state by sending ack frames covering a large range of packet numbers (including packet numbers that had never been sent); see rfc 9000 section 19.3. the victim could grow the congestion window beyond typical expectations and allow more bytes in flight than the path might really support. in extreme cases, the window might grow beyond the limit of the internal variable's type, leading to an overflow panic.

module_init(init)
module_exit(deinit)
module_license("gpl");

the root cause of the bug sits in neon_poly1305_blocks. the logic
neon_poly1305_blocks() performed is that if it was called with both s[]
and r[] uninitialized, it will first try to initialize them with the
data from the first "block" that it believed to be 32 bytes in length.
first 16 bytes are used as the key and the next 16 bytes for s[]. this
would lead to the aforementioned read out-of-bound. however, after
calling poly1305_init_arch(), only 16 bytes were deducted from the input
and s[] is initialized yet again with the following 16 bytes. the second
initialization of s[] is certainly redundent which indicates that the
first initialization should be for r[] only.

this patch fixes the issue by calling poly1305_init_arm64() instead o
