                <div class="cve-entry" data-cve-id="CVE-2025-40003" data-description="in the linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: mscc: ocelot: fix use-after-free caused by cyclic delayed work

the origin code calls cancel_delayed_work() in ocelot_stats_deinit()
to cancel the cyclic delayed work item ocelot->stats_work. however,
cancel_delayed_work() may fail to cancel the work item if it is already
executing. while destroy_workqueue() does wait for all pending work items
in the work queue to complete before destroying the work queue, it cannot
prevent the delayed work item from being rescheduled within the
ocelot_check_stats_work() function. this limitation exists because the
delayed work item is only enqueued into the work queue after its timer
expires. before the timer expiration, destroy_workqueue() has no visibility
of this pending work item. once the work queue appears empty,
destroy_workqueue() proceeds with destruction. when the timer eventually
expires, the delayed work item gets queued again, leading to the following
warning:

the following diagram reveals the cause of the above warning:

cpu 0 (remove)             | cpu 1 (delayed work callback)
mscc_ocelot_remove()       |
  ocelot_deinit()          | ocelot_check_stats_work()
    ocelot_stats_deinit()  |
      cancel_delayed_work()|   ...
                           |   queue_delayed_work()
      destroy_workqueue()  | (wait a time)
                           | __queue_work() //uaf

the above scenario actually constitutes a uaf vulnerability.

the ocelot_stats_deinit() is only invoked when initialization
failure or resource destruction, so we must ensure that any
delayed work items cannot be rescheduled.

replace cancel_delayed_work() with disable_delayed_work_sync()
to guarantee proper cancellation of the delayed work item and
ensure completion of any currently executing work before the
workqueue is deallocated.

a deadlock concern was considered: ocelot_stats_deinit() is called
in a process context and is not holding any locks that the delayed
work item might also need. therefore, the use of the _sync() variant
is safe here.

this bug was identified through static analysis. to reproduce the
issue and validate the fix, i simulated ocelot-swit

net: mscc: ocelot: Fix use-after-free caused by cyclic delayed work

The origin code calls cancel_delayed_work() in ocelot_stats_deinit()
to cancel the cyclic delayed work item ocelot->stats_work. However,
cancel_delayed_work() may fail to cancel the work item if it is already
executing. While destroy_workqueue() does wait for all pending work items
in the work queue to complete before destroying the work queue, it cannot
prevent the delayed work item from being rescheduled within the
ocelot_check_stats_work() function. This limitation exists because the
delayed work item is only enqueued into the work queue after its timer
expires. Before the timer expiration, destroy_workqueue() has no visibility
of this pending work item. Once the work queue appears empty,
destroy_workqueue() proceeds with destruction. When the timer eventually
expires, the delayed work item gets queued again, leading to the following
warning:

The following diagram reveals the cause of the above warning:

CPU 0 (remove)             | CPU 1 (delayed work callback)
mscc_ocelot_remove()       |
  ocelot_deinit()          | ocelot_check_stats_work()
    ocelot_stats_deinit()  |
      cancel_delayed_work()|   ...
                           |   queue_delayed_work()
      destroy_workqueue()  | (wait a time)
                           | __queue_work() //UAF

The above scenario actually constitutes a UAF vulnerability.

The ocelot_stats_deinit() is only invoked when initialization
failure or resource destruction, so we must ensure that any
delayed work items cannot be rescheduled.

Replace cancel_delayed_work() with disable_delayed_work_sync()
to guarantee proper cancellation of the delayed work item and
ensure completion of any currently executing work before the
workqueue is deallocated.

A deadlock concern was considered: ocelot_stats_deinit() is called
in a process context and is not holding any locks that the delayed
work item might also need. Therefore, the use of the _sync() variant
is safe here.

This bug was identified through static analysis. To reproduce the
issue and validate the fix, I simulated ocelot-swit

thunderbolt: fix use-after-free in tb_dp_dprx_work

the original code relies on cancel_delayed_work() in tb_dp_dprx_stop(),
which does not ensure that the delayed work item tunnel->dprx_work has
fully completed if it was already running. this leads to use-after-free
scenarios where tb_tunnel is deallocated by tb_tunnel_put(), while
tunnel->dprx_work remains active and attempts to dereference tb_tunnel
in tb_dp_dprx_work().

a typical race condition is illustrated below:

cpu 0                            | cpu 1
tb_dp_tunnel_active()            |
  tb_deactivate_and_free_tunnel()| tb_dp_dprx_start()
    tb_tunnel_deactivate()       |   queue_delayed_work()

                                 |   tunnel-> //uaf

replacing cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() is
not feasible as it would introduce a deadlock: both tb_dp_dprx_work()
and the cleanup path acquire tb->lock, and cancel_delayed_work_sync()
would wait indefinitely for the work item that cannot proceed.

instead, implement proper reference counting:
- if cancel_delayed_work() returns true (work is pending), we release
  the reference in the stop function.
- if it returns false (work is executing or already completed), the
  reference is released in delayed work function itself.

this ensures the tb_tunnel remains valid during work item execution
while preventing memory leaks.
