                    <p>The Reales WP STPT plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized user registration in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.2. This is due to the 'reales_user_signup_form' AJAX action not verifying if user registration is enabled, prior to registering a user. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create new user accounts, which can be leveraged with CVE-XX to achieve privilege escalation.</p>
