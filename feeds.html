                    <p>A vulnerability exists in Advantech iView that allows for argument 
injection in NetworkServlet.backupDatabase(). This issue requires an 
authenticated attacker with at least user-level privileges. Certain 
parameters can be used directly in a command without proper 
sanitization, allowing arbitrary arguments to be injected. This can 
result in information disclosure, including sensitive database 
credentials.</p>
