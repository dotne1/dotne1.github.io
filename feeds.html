                    <p>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: ipset: Fix overflow before widen in the bitmap_ip_create() function.

When first_ip is 0, last_ip is 0xFFFFFFFF, and netmask is 31, the value of
an arithmetic expression 2 << (netmask - mask_bits - 1) is subject
to overflow due to a failure casting operands to a larger data type
before performing the arithmetic.

Note that it's harmless since the value will be checked at the next step.

(linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.</p>

fix the issue by changing the mutex lock to spinlock.

two ->aura_freeptr() callbacks, otx2_aura_freeptr() and
cn10k_aura_freeptr(). there is no usage of perpcu variable in the
otx2_aura_freeptr() at all, so the get/put_cpu() seems redundant to it.
we can move the get/put_cpu() into the corresponding callback which
really has the percpu variable usage and avoid the sprinkling of
get/put_cpu() in several places.">

Of course, we can shuffle the get/put_cpu() to only wrap the invocation
of ->aura_freeptr() as what commit 87b93b678e95 does. But there are only
two ->aura_freeptr() callbacks, otx2_aura_freeptr() and
cn10k_aura_freeptr(). There is no usage of perpcu variable in the
otx2_aura_freeptr() at all, so the get/put_cpu() seems redundant to it.
We can move the get/put_cpu() into the corresponding callback which
really has the percpu variable usage and avoid the sprinkling of
get/put_cpu() in several places.</p>
