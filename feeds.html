the exploit is only applicable if the client code of parquet-avro uses the "specific" or the "reflect" models deliberately for reading parquet files. ("generic" model is not impacted)

users are recommended to upgrade to 1.15.2 or set the system property "org.apache.parquet.avro.serializable_packages" to an empty string on 1.15.1. both are sufficient to fix the issue.">
