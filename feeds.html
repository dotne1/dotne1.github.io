the reproducer uses a file0 on a ntfs3 file system with a corrupted i_link.

name cannot be deleted.

the underlying bug is that make_bad_inode() is called on a live inode.
in some cases it's "icache lookup finds a normal inode, d_splice_alias()
is called to attach it to dentry, while another thread decides to call
make_bad_inode() on it - that would evict it from icache, but we'd already
found it there earlier".
in some it's outright "we have an inode attached to dentry - that's how we

and giggles".">

eventpoll: fix semi-unbounded recursion

ensure that epoll instances can never form a graph deeper than
ep_max_nests+1 links.

currently, ep_loop_check_proc() ensures that the graph is loop-free and
does some recursion depth checks, but those recursion depth checks don't
limit the depth of the resulting tree for two reasons:

 - they don't look upwards in the tree.
 - if there are multiple downwards paths of different lengths, only one of
   the paths is actually considered for the depth check since commit
   28d82dc1c4ed ("epoll: limit paths").

essentially, the current recursion depth check in ep_loop_check_proc() just
serves to prevent it from recursing too deeply while checking for loops.

a more thorough check is done in reverse_path_check() after the new graph
edge has already been created; this checks, among other things, that no
paths going upwards from any non-epoll file with a length of more than 5
edges exist. however, this check does not apply to non-epoll files.

as a result, it is possible to recurse to a depth of at least roughly 500,
tested on v6.15. (i am unsure if deeper recursion is possible; and this may
have changed with commit 8c44dac8add7 ("eventpoll: fix priority inversion
problem").)

to fix it:

1. in ep_loop_check_proc(), note the subtree depth of each visited node,
and use subtree depths for the total depth calculation even when a subtree
has already been visited.
2. add ep_get_upwards_depth_proc() for similarly determining the maximum
depth of an upwards walk.
3. in ep_loop_check(), use these values to limit the total path length
between epoll nodes to ep_max_nests edges.">
