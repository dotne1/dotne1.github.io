this issue may allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to intercept or redirect log traffic under the following conditions:

  *  the attacker is able to intercept or redirect network traffic between the client and the log receiver.
  *  the attacker can present a server certificate issued by a certification authority trusted by the socket appender’s configured trust store (or by the default java trust store if no custom trust store is configured).


users are advised to upgrade to apache log4j core version 2.25.3, which addresses this issue.

as an alternative mitigation, the socket appender may be configured to use a private or restricted trust root to limit the set of trusted certificates.">

Tools avahi-resolve, avahi-resolve-address and avahi-resolve-host-name are not affected, they use DBus interface. It is possible to change permissions of unix socket after avahi-daemon is started. But avahi-daemon does not provide any configuration for it. Additional access restrictions like SELinux can also prevent unwanted tools to access the socket and keep resolution working for trusted users.</p>
