iommu/amd/pgtbl: fix possible race while increase page table level

the amd iommu host page table implementation supports dynamic page table levels
(up to 6 levels), starting with a 3-level configuration that expands based on
iova address. the kernel maintains a root pointer and current page table level
to enable proper page table walks in alloc_pte()/fetch_pte() operations.

the iommu iova allocator initially starts with 32-bit address and onces its
exhuasted it switches to 64-bit address (max address is determined based
on iommu and device dma capability). to support larger iova, amd iommu
driver increases page table level.

but in unmap path (iommu_v1_unmap_pages()), fetch_pte() reads
pgtable->[root/mode] without lock. so its possible that in exteme corner case,
when increase_address_space() is updating pgtable->[root/mode], fetch_pte()
reads wrong page table level (pgtable->mode). it does compare the value with
level encoded in page table and returns null. this will result is
iommu_unmap ops to fail and upper layer may retry/log warn_on.
