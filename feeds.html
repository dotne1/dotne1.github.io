the root cause of the bug sits in neon_poly1305_blocks. the logic
neon_poly1305_blocks() performed is that if it was called with both s[]
and r[] uninitialized, it will first try to initialize them with the
data from the first "block" that it believed to be 32 bytes in length.
first 16 bytes are used as the key and the next 16 bytes for s[]. this
would lead to the aforementioned read out-of-bound. however, after
calling poly1305_init_arch(), only 16 bytes were deducted from the input
and s[] is initialized yet again with the following 16 bytes. the second
initialization of s[] is certainly redundent which indicates that the
first initialization should be for r[] only.

this patch fixes the issue by calling poly1305_init_arm64() instead o

KVM: SVM: Don't BUG if userspace injects an interrupt with GIF=0

Don't BUG/WARN on interrupt injection due to GIF being cleared,
since it's trivial for userspace to force the situation via
KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS (even if having at least a WARN there would be correct
for KVM internally generated injections).

LoongArch: cpuinfo: Fix a warning for CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK

When CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK and CONFIG_DEBUG_PER_CPU_MAPS is selected,
cpu_max_bits_warn() generates a runtime warning similar as below while
we show /proc/cpuinfo. Fix this by using nr_cpu_ids (the runtime limit)
instead of NR_CPUS to iterate CPUs.

usbnet: fix linkwatch use-after-free on disconnect

usbnet uses the work usbnet_deferred_kevent() to perform tasks which may
sleep.  on disconnect, completion of the work was originally awaited in
->ndo_stop().  but in 2003, that was moved to ->disconnect() by historic
commit "[patch] usb: usbnet, prevent exotic rtnl deadlock":

  https://git.kernel.org/tglx/history/c/0f138bbfd83c

the change was made because back then, the kernel's workqueue
implementation did not allow waiting for a single work.  one had to wait
for completion of *all* work by calling flush_scheduled_work(), and that
could deadlock when waiting for usbnet_deferred_kevent() with rtnl_mutex
held in ->ndo_stop().

the commit solved one problem but created another:  it causes a
use-after-free in usb ethernet drivers aqc111.c, asix_devices.c,
ax88179_178a.c, ch9200.c and smsc75xx.c:

* if the drivers receive a link change interrupt immediately before
  disconnect, they raise event_link_reset in their (non-sleepable)
  ->status() callback and schedule usbnet_deferred_kevent().
* usbnet_deferred_kevent() invokes the driver's ->link_reset() callback,
  which calls netif_carrier_{on,off}().
* that in turn schedules the work linkwatch_event().

because usbnet_deferred_kevent() is awaited after unregister_netdev(),
netif_carrier_{on,off}() may operate on an unregistered netdev and
linkwatch_event() may run after free_netdev(), causing a use-after-free.

in 2010, usbnet was changed to only wait for a single instance of
usbnet_deferred_kevent() instead of *all* work by commit 23f333a2bfaf
("drivers/net: don't use flush_scheduled_work()").

unfortunately the commit neglected to move the wait back to
->ndo_stop().  rectify that omission at long last.">

bpf: fix kasan use-after-free read in compute_effective_progs

syzbot found a use after free bug in compute_effective_progs().
the reproducer creates a number of bpf links, and causes a fault

link detach triggers the link to be freed by bpf_link_free(),

if the memory allocation in this function fails, the function restores
the pointer to the bpf_cgroup_link on the cgroup list, but the memory
gets freed just after it returns. after this, every subsequent call to
update_effective_progs() causes this already deallocated pointer to be
dereferenced in prog_list_length(), and triggers kasan uaf error.

to fix this issue don't preserve the pointer to the prog or link in the

                    <p>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: light: isl29028: Fix the warning in isl29028_remove()

The driver use the non-managed form of the register function in
isl29028_remove(). To keep the release order as mirroring the ordering
in probe, the driver should use non-managed form in probe, too.

The following log reveals it:

coresight: clear the connection field properly

coresight devices track their connections (output connections) and
hold a reference to the fwnode. when a device goes away, we walk through
the devices on the coresight bus and make sure that the references
are dropped. this happens both ways:
 a) for all output connections from the device, drop the reference to
    the target device via coresight_release_platform_data()

b) iterate over all the devices on the coresight bus and drop the
   reference to fwnode if *this* device is the target of the output
   connection, via coresight_remove_conns()->coresight_remove_match().

however, the coresight_remove_match() doesn't clear the fwnode field,
after dropping the reference, this causes use-after-free and
additional refcount drops on the fwnode.

e.g., if we have two devices, a and b, with a connection, a -> b.
if we remove b first, b would clear the reference on b, from a
via coresight_remove_match(). but when a is removed, it still has
a connection with fwnode still pointing to b. thus it tries to  drops
the reference in coresight_release_platform_data(), raising the bells
like :

                    <p>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

coresight: Clear the connection field properly

coresight devices track their connections (output connections) and
hold a reference to the fwnode. When a device goes away, we walk through
the devices on the coresight bus and make sure that the references
are dropped. This happens both ways:
 a) For all output connections from the device, drop the reference to
    the target device via coresight_release_platform_data()

b) Iterate over all the devices on the coresight bus and drop the
   reference to fwnode if *this* device is the target of the output
   connection, via coresight_remove_conns()->coresight_remove_match().

However, the coresight_remove_match() doesn't clear the fwnode field,
after dropping the reference, this causes use-after-free and
additional refcount drops on the fwnode.

e.g., if we have two devices, A and B, with a connection, A -> B.
If we remove B first, B would clear the reference on B, from A
via coresight_remove_match(). But when A is removed, it still has
a connection with fwnode still pointing to B. Thus it tries to  drops
the reference in coresight_release_platform_data(), raising the bells
like :
