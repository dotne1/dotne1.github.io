Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.451, an authenticated command injection vulnerability in PostgreSQL Init Script Filename handling allows users with application/service management permissions to execute arbitrary commands as root on managed servers. PostgreSQL initialization script filenames are passed to shell commands without proper validation, enabling full remote code execution. Version 4.0.0-beta.451 fixes the issue.</p>
