If only lower-case (common default) filters are present in Shiro, they may be bypassed this way.

Shiro 2.0.7 and later has a new parameters to remediate this issue
shiro.ini: filterChainResolver.caseInsensitive = true
application.propertie: shiro.caseInsensitive=true

Shiro 3.0.0 and later (upcoming) makes this the default.</p>
