            <h2>Home Lab Proxmox Server</h2>
            <p>Transformed a Dell R540 PowerEdge into a virtualization beast—quad Xeon 6-core CPUs, 96GB RAM, and 4TB storage. Runs VMs for network experiments, CTF labs, Vlans and whatever else I throw at it. My digital sandbox.</p>

            <h2>Raspberry Pi Ecosystem</h2>
            <p>A swarm of Pi projects: headless learning PCs for my kids, mini robots we built together, a Pi-hole blocking ads network-wide, a PiVPN for secure remote access, and a Pi 5 running Grok with an AI GPU (xAI key from '24). Small boards, big chaos.</p>

            <h2>Discord Bot Development</h2>
            <p>Kicked off my Python journey in 2016 with Discord bots. Now I host and maintain several for gaming communities—think automation, fun commands, and keeping servers alive. Still tweaking them for Path of Exile and beyond.</p>

            <h2>CPU Crypto Farm</h2>
            <p>Assembled 18 cheap refurb CPUs, overclocked and water-cooled, mining RandomX. It's a small-scale rig, but I've tuned it to squeeze every hash out—crypto tinkering meets hardware OCD.</p>

            <h2>TryHackMe & CTF Challenges</h2>
            <p>Grinding TryHackMe since '23—hit #862 in the US for Advent of Cyber 2024 and top 3% solo players nationwide (inside top 10k overall). Chasing Sec+ and OSCP, one flag at a time.</p>

            <h2>dotne1.github.io Dashboard</h2>
            <p>Built and maintain this site as my digital HQ—bookmarks, badges, and a cyberpunk vibe. Keeps my favorite tools and projects organized, updated, and neon-lit for the world to see.</p>

            <h2>Ubuntu Gaming Rig with AI Graphics</h2>
            <p>Upgraded my Ubuntu rig with an RX 6600XT and Mesa drivers for Path of Exile 2. Leveraging AI-driven downscaling/upscaling (think FSR-style tech) to boost frames and visuals—smart rendering for a smoother grind.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h2>TOR Web Scraper Bot</h2>
            <p>Built a TOR-powered web scraper bot since 2019—pulls CISA CVE alerts and dark web news in real time. Added nmap and dirbuster scans behind TOR's veil, hosted on AWS. Now spinning it into a dashboard for live threat feeds—hacker intel, my way.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h2>Pi-hole Threat Logger</h2>
            <p>Supercharged my Pi-hole to log and dissect blocked domains. Wrote a Python script to flag sketchy traffic—like phishing traps—and ping alerts to Discord. Keeping my network clean and my hacker senses sharp.</p>
